### **Introduction: The Visitor of the Night**

One o'clock in the morning, the city sinks into profound silence, only the occasional distant sound of a car, like a weary sigh.

My friend Qiming, once again at this hour, stares blankly at the ceiling.

His body is like a wrung-out sponge, every cell screaming for "rest." His eyelids are heavy as if weighted with lead; a full day of high-intensity work has already drained all his energy. Yet, his brain, that disobedient, overactive, self-willed command center, is hosting a grand party.

"Two details for tomorrow morning's meeting materials still need to be finalized."
"The project to follow up on this afternoon, the wording of the reply needs to be reconsidered."
"Oh, I forgot to renew the car insurance."
"I promised to take the kids to the science museum last week, can I make it happen this weekend?"
"Did that unintentional remark cause a misunderstanding with my colleague?"

Thoughts, like runaway wild horses, gallop wildly across the grassland of his skull, stirring up dust. Each thought is a hook, pulling him back from the edge of sleep into the abyss of wakefulness, time and again. He has tried all the popular methods: deep breathing, counting sheep until the flock started protesting, opening a meditation app and listening to soothing guided instructions, only to find himself silently analyzing the guide's pronunciation.

"I just want to get some sleep," Qiming told me with a bitter smile during a late-night chat. "Why does it feel like fighting a battle I can never win? My body has clearly surrendered, but my brain is stubbornly holding its ground."

Qiming's dilemma, I believe, is not unfamiliar to you. Perhaps you are him, or perhaps there are countless "Qimings" around you. We live in an era that values efficiency and control; we are accustomed to making lists for life and setting KPIs for work. We believe that as long as we use the right methods, all problems can be "solved." So, when sleep, this most primitive and instinctual behavior, also begins to "lose control," we fall into a deep sense of frustration and anxiety.

We treat insomnia as a bug, a system malfunction that needs to be fixed. We search online for "ten tips for falling asleep fast," we buy expensive melatonin and ergonomic pillows, we try to "deal with" it using various tools, like a strict engineer treating a malfunctioning machine.

But the harder we try, the tighter that door to dreamland seems to close.

This article does not intend to give you another "sleep aid tip list." Because the root of the problem may not be that we lack techniques, but that we have stood in the wrong position and adopted the wrong posture from the very beginning.

I want to invite you to temporarily lay down all "battle" weapons and look at this late-night visitor from a different perspective.

What if insomnia is not an enemy to be eliminated?

What if it's not an accidental malfunction, but a premeditated visit? What if it's a messenger, weary from travel, only to deliver a letter from the deepest part of your heart, a letter you've ignored for too long in the daytime hustle and bustle?

This messenger might seem unkempt, even a bit rough, but its intention is not to deprive you of rest, but to be heard. It's saying in this intense way: "Hey, stop, look at me. There are things you can no longer pretend not to see."

This letter might contain your suppressed anxieties, hidden desires, or recorded fatigue warnings from your body, or perhaps, just a vibrant inspiration eager to be expressed.

What we need is not to drive away this messenger with more noise, but to quiet down, pour him a cup of tea, gather courage, open that letter, and read every word of it.

This is a late-night conversation with the self.

In this book, we will learn together how to become a patient and gentle listener. We will no longer be at odds with insomnia but learn its language and understand its intentions. We will explore how to build a peaceful sanctuary for the brain's "manager" when he works overtime late at night; how to give the inner "artist" a stage for expression when he is passionate; and how to play a meaningless game with the tired "clown" when he is weary of everything.

Ultimately, you will find that true tranquility comes not from victory, but from reconciliation.

When you finally understand that letter and say to the messenger, "Thank you, I hear you," he will smile and quietly depart.

And sleep, after this gentle reconciliation, will naturally arrive as the sweetest gift.

So, are you ready? Let's turn off the harsh overhead lights, light a warm bedside lamp, and begin this long conversation with ourselves and the night.

### **Chapter One: The Illusion of Control – Why the More You Try, the More Awake You Become**

Have you ever had this experience?

You lie in bed and tell yourself, "Okay, relax, don't think about anything, it's time to sleep."

This sentence is like a magic spell. The moment you utter it, your brain immediately becomes more alert than ever. It will immediately begin to "check" if you are truly relaxed. "Are my shoulders relaxed? They still feel a bit tight. Is my breathing deep enough? Is it too deliberate? My legs feel a bit numb. Oh, is that thought still there? Damn, it's still there."

The more you command yourself "don't think," the more your thoughts surge, like an endless barrage of comments. The more you crave "relaxation," the stiffer your body becomes, like a rookie giving a speech for the first time.

This is the first and most central paradox of sleep: **we can never achieve "relaxation" through "effort."**

It sounds convoluted, but it's precisely the quagmire most insomniacs find themselves in. Our era almost deifies "effort" and "control." We firmly believe that as long as we put in enough effort and energy, we can control the direction of our careers, the increase or decrease of wealth, and even the trajectory of our lives. We are the masters of our own lives, the CEOs of our own destinies.

This belief is often effective in the daytime world. It drives us to learn, work, and create value. But when night falls, and we bring this "control everything" success logic into the bedroom, a war destined for failure begins.

Imagine you are in a wrestling match with someone. Your goal is to pin them to the ground. You exert all your strength, mobilize every muscle, and use various techniques. But you soon discover that this match is incredibly difficult. Because for every bit of strength you use, your opponent's strength seems to increase by the same amount. The harder you fight, the more stubbornly they resist. You roll back and forth on the mat, sweating, exhausted, but you can never determine a winner.

Until finally, you lie on the ground, utterly exhausted, and suddenly realize an absurd truth—the opponent you've been wrestling with all night is yourself.

"Trying to sleep" is such a wrestling match with yourself.

The "you who wants to sleep" is the referee and one of the contestants. And the "uncontrolled" and wandering "you" is the other. The more the "you who wants to sleep" tries, the more anxiously it tries to suppress and control the "you who won't sleep," the more intense your inner conflict becomes, and the more your entire nervous system is in a state of high "readiness."

How can sleep occur in such a state? Sleep, physiologically speaking, is the result of the parasympathetic nervous system taking over; it's responsible for our body's "rest and digest" mode. "Fighting," whether real or imagined, is dominated by the sympathetic nervous system, which makes our heart race, breathing quicken, and muscles tense, ready for "fight or flight."

You cannot step on the gas pedal and expect the car to stop. Similarly, you cannot keep your mind on a battlefield and expect your body to enter dreamland.

Many friends, like Qiming, have fallen into an even deeper trap—"relaxation anxiety." They learned various relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, body scans, and guided imagery. These are excellent tools, but driven by a "control" mindset, they became distorted.

They would mentally grade their relaxation process. "Today's meditation focus was only 60 points, not good enough." "During the body scan, the feeling in my left foot wasn't clear enough, failure." "The guided imagery wasn't even over, and I started thinking about work, I got distracted again."

Relaxation became a new KPI. Sleep became an exam that could only be passed by "correctly executing relaxation techniques." The pressure of this exam even exceeded that of daytime work. So, they not only had anxiety about "unfinished work" but also double anxiety about "poorly done relaxation."

Doesn't this sound absurd? But this is the drama we enact on ourselves every day.

Therefore, before we continue to explore any specific "methods," we must first complete a fundamental "mindset demolition." We must shake, even destroy, the belief deeply rooted within us—"I can, and should, control my sleep."

The truth is, you cannot.

Sleep, like love, inspiration, and happiness, is a state that occurs naturally. It is a "welcome," not a "capture." It's more like a guest; you can only clean the room for him, light a warm lamp, prepare a comfortable bed, and then quietly wait for his arrival. You cannot rush to the door, rudely drag him in, let alone get furious because he didn't arrive at the time you expected.

The more anxiously you peek through the crack in the door, the more likely this sensitive guest is to pass by without entering.

Therefore, all the "principles" introduced later in this book, whether order, expression, or play, are not weapons for you to "conquer" sleep. On the contrary, they are exercises for you to learn to "lay down your weapons." Their purpose is not for you to better "control" your brain, but for you to learn to coexist peacefully with the "out of control" part.

From this moment on, please try to repeat a sentence to yourself in your mind:

**"I don't have to conquer my wakefulness; I just need to accompany my wakefulness."**

Let this sentence be the cornerstone of our journey ahead. Giving up the fight is the first step towards tranquility. When we stop wrestling with ourselves, we can hear the true voice within, and understand what that late-night visitor truly wants to tell us.

It's hard, I know. Because "giving up control," for us modern people accustomed to controlling everything, is itself a profound fear.

But please trust me, behind that fear lies the door to freedom and peace. And we are about to gently push it open, together.

### **Chapter Two: Basic Self-Check – Listening to the Body's Primal Language**

Before we plunge headfirst into the vast and complex forest of our inner world, to explore deep questions about "meaning," "anxiety," and "existence," we must first do one thing.

Something extremely simple, yet often completely forgotten by us "overthinking" modern people.

That is, to look down and see the ground beneath our feet—our body.

We are too accustomed to treating the body as a silent vessel serving the brain. It works tirelessly, carrying our ambitions, fatigue, desires, and sorrows. We only glance at it impatiently when it hurts, gets sick, or goes on strike, thinking, "What's wrong with you again?"

However, the body possesses an older, more honest wisdom than we imagine. It doesn't engage in complex philosophical contemplation like the brain, nor does it stage dramatic inner plays like emotions. Its language is primal, direct, and undeniable.

It continuously sends us signals through the most fundamental words: "hot" and "cold," "tight" and "loose," "comfort" and "discomfort."

Many times, the "stormy waves" that keep us tossing and turning late at night do not stem from some profound existential crisis or philosophical dilemma, but merely from the body's simplest cry for help. A cry of "I'm too hot," a cry of "I've been steeped in caffeine for too long," or a cry of "my back is breaking."

Sadly, our brain, that "screenwriter" who loves complex plots, often ignores these simple, direct signals. It is more inclined to over-interpret this physical discomfort as a complex psychological drama. Thus, a disturbance that could have been quelled by "throwing off the covers" or "doing some stretches" is ultimately dramatized into an all-night debate about "midlife crisis" or "the meaning of life."

This is not to deny the importance of psychological factors, but to emphasize a fundamental order: first settle the honest "animal" that is the body, then listen to the complex "poet" within.

Therefore, before you begin any psychological exploration, be sure to complete this "body hardware" self-check list. This might be the most immediate, unflashy, and important thing you can do for your sleep.

**Body Hardware Self-Check List (The Animal Check-in)**

Please act like a diligent zookeeper. Before preparing your "pet" (which is yourself) for sleep, quickly check and address the following fundamental physical factors:

**1. Light: Is your cave dark enough?**

Our ancestors rose with the sun and rested with it. This rhythm is etched deep into our genes. Light, especially the ubiquitous, blue-light-rich screen light of our era, is the strongest signal telling our body, "It's daytime, stay alert."

When you're still scrolling on your phone, looking at a flickering screen, or working under bright lights an hour before bed, you're essentially shouting at your body: "Hey! Don't sleep! Get up and party!" This will greatly inhibit the secretion of a hormone called "melatonin" in your body, which is a key messenger guiding us into sleep.

**Action Directives:**
- **Execute a "Digital Sunset":** Set a bedtime alarm (e.g., 10:30 PM), name it "Digital Sunset." When the alarm rings, treat it like a quitting-time bell and immediately put down all electronic devices.
- **Dim the lights:** Replace the main light source in your bedroom with a soft, warm-toned bedside lamp. Let the environment enter "dusk mode" in advance.
- **Physical Isolation:** If external light pollution is unavoidable, invest in quality blackout curtains or a comfortable eye mask. Simple and crude, but extremely effective.

**2. Temperature: Are you in "cool" rather than "warm"?**

This is a common misconception. We always think a warm bed is standard for sleep, but physiology tells us that the body's core temperature naturally drops when falling asleep. A relatively cool sleeping environment can more effectively help the body initiate this "cooling" process, thus falling asleep faster.

If you often wake up hot in the middle of the night, or feel suffocated by the stuffiness in bed, it's likely that your "cave" temperature is too high.

**Action Directives:**
- **Adjust room temperature:** Set the air conditioner to a comfortable range that makes you feel "slightly cool" rather than "warm" (usually between 18-22 degrees Celsius, varies by individual).
- **Choose appropriate bedding:** Use more breathable quilts and sleepwear, especially for people who sweat easily.
- **Warm bath before bed:** Take a warm bath 1-2 hours before bed. This will dilate your blood vessels, and after leaving the bathroom, your body's core temperature will naturally drop due to heat dissipation, which will induce strong sleepiness.

**3. Intake: Are there "uninvited guests" in your body?**

That latte you drank at 3 PM, those two extra glasses of red wine with dinner, or that chocolate cake you snacked on before bed—these are "uninvited guests" that sneak into your body late at night.

- **Caffeine:** As a central nervous system stimulant, its half-life (the time it takes for the body to metabolize half of it) is 4-6 hours. This means the coffee you drank in the afternoon could very well continue its effects into the late night, like an invisible hand, supporting your excited nerves from behind.
- **Alcohol:** While alcohol can make you feel sleepy quickly, it severely disrupts later sleep architecture, causing frequent awakenings and making you feel more tired upon waking. It creates "stupor," not true "rest."
- **Sugar:** Consuming large amounts of sugar before bed can cause your blood sugar to sharply rise and fall like a roller coaster. This process can stimulate adrenaline secretion, causing you to wake up suddenly in the middle of the night.

**Action Directives:**
- **Set "No-Intake" times:** Try to avoid caffeine after mid-afternoon (e.g., 2 PM). Avoid alcohol and large meals, especially high-sugar desserts, within three hours of bedtime.
- **Establish a "bedtime drink" habit:** If you need to drink something before bed, choose a cup of warm milk, a caffeine-free herbal tea (like chamomile), or simply a cup of warm water.

**4. Body: Is a part of your body "crying silently"?**

For us modern people who sit for long periods, it's almost normal for a part of the body to be in a state of tension or discomfort. It could be tight shoulders and neck, sore lower back, or restless legs.

During the day, we might ignore these discomforts through willpower. But at night, when everything is quiet, these "cries" from the body will be infinitely amplified, becoming unavoidable noise that continuously disturbs us.

**Action Directives:**
- **Perform gentle pre-sleep stretches:** No strenuous exercise is needed, just 5-10 minutes of gentle static stretching for the areas where you feel most tension. For example, gently rotate your neck, stretch your back, or stretch your hamstrings.
- **Pay attention to your sleeping position:** Find a sleeping position that allows all your muscles to completely relax. Sometimes, placing a small pillow under your knees or lower back can greatly relieve body pressure.
- **Invest in a good mattress and pillow:** These are partners we spend one-third of our lives intimately with. Ensure they provide adequate and correct support for your body.

Completing this checklist might only take you a dozen minutes. But its significance goes far beyond that.

It's a declaration, a shift in posture. It means you begin to acknowledge that the body is not just an appendage of the brain; it has its own language and needs. It means you begin to learn to be a considerate caregiver before becoming a profound thinker.

When you have provided your body with a dark, cool, comfortable environment free of "troublemakers," you have laid the most basic groundwork for the arrival of sleep.

At this point, if your brain still cannot calm down, then, good.

This indicates that the late-night visitor has indeed brought a letter about the "mind."

Now, we can finally, peacefully, open it.

### **Chapter Three: The Crossroads of Thought – Identifying Your "Insomnia Mode"**

Alright, now we've provided the honest animal that is our body with everything it needs: a cool, dark, comfortable cave, ensuring no uninvited guests (like caffeine) are messing with its system.

But you find that the brain's party still shows no signs of ending.

This is precisely the most exciting part of the journey. Because it's almost certain that what's keeping you awake now is no longer mere physical discomfort, but a deeper, more complex psychological energy. That late-night messenger has finally, slowly, unfolded the letter from your inner self before you.

However, this letter is written in a special ink; it has no uniform format, and its content is not always straightforward. For different people, and even for the same person on different nights, the content of the letter can be completely different.

After many late-night conversations with friends like Qiming, I've found that while the details of the letter vary infinitely, its core "drama type" can often be categorized into three. When our minds can't stop turning late at night, it's usually enacting one of the following three dramas.

Identifying which drama you are enacting tonight is key to choosing the correct response. It's like standing at a crossroads, seeing the road signs, and then knowing which direction to take.

Now, let's become the audience of our inner theater and see who the protagonist is tonight.

**Mode One: The Overloaded "Manager"**

**Inner monologue:** *"No, I have to think about it again... The third page of tomorrow's report, the data citation seems problematic. Oh, the email to send to the client this afternoon, I need to adjust the tone. Also, next week's team meeting, the agenda needs to be prepared in advance. Oh, the children's extracurricular classes need to be renewed, and the gas bill needs to be paid, I must write it down. I can't sleep because I have too many things I haven't 'dealt with'."*

**Dramatic characteristics:**
In "Manager" mode, your brain is like a 24/7 project management center that never shuts down. The core of your thoughts is **"tasks"** and **"responsibilities."** It constantly reviews the past ("What did I do poorly today?") and plans the future ("What do I need to do tomorrow?").

Every thought here is like a to-do item, a checklist item that needs to be crossed off. Your brain is immersed in a "problem-solving" inertia, believing that if it just goes over all these unresolved matters in its head, or even finds perfect solutions, it can then sleep peacefully.

The thinking in this mode is **linear, logical, and goal-oriented.** It's full of "shoulds," "musts," and "what ifs." You feel like a company CEO, bearing the pressure of the entire company's operation alone in the dead of night. You dare not sleep because you fear that once you fall asleep, some important detail will be forgotten, or some potential risk will spiral out of control.

**Core feelings:** **Anxiety, tension, a persistent desire for control and a sense of responsibility.** You feel tightly bound by an invisible net of "to-do items," unable to move.

**Mode Two: The Unfinished "Artist"**

**Inner monologue:** *"Oh my god, I just had a brilliant idea! If I did that project this way, the effect would be explosive! I have to write it down. This feeling is amazing, I can feel my blood boiling. Or, that conversation with a friend this afternoon, it touched me so deeply, that complex emotion, that subtle connection between people, if I could just write it down... I can't sleep because there's a fire in my heart, it's burning, it longs to be expressed."*

**Dramatic characteristics:**
In "Artist" mode, your brain transforms into a creative studio full of inspiration. The core of your thoughts is no longer cold "tasks," but a scorching **"energy"** or **"emotion."** This energy might stem from a brilliant idea, a profound conversation, a moving film, or even a sudden, deep sadness about past events. Regardless of its external form, whether joy or sorrow, its inner essence is the same—it is a life force that longs to be "seen," "heard," and "expressed."

Every thought here is like a raw gem waiting to be sculpted, a poem about to be born. Your thinking is **divergent, associative, full of colors and images.** It doesn't care about "getting things done"; it only cares about "creating" and "expressing."

In this mode, you don't suffer from insomnia because of "anxiety"; on the contrary, you might feel unusually excited, sharp, or even euphoric. You don't "want" to sleep because sleeping feels like a waste, an abrupt interruption of this precious creative impulse or profound emotional experience. You feel like an inspired painter or poet, dancing with your muse late into the night.

**Core feelings:** **Excitement, exhilaration, creative urge, a strong impulse to express, or a profound emotion (whether joy or sorrow) that needs to be sorted out and settled.**

**Mode Three: The Exhausted "Clown"**

**Inner monologue:** *"Sleep, sleep, sleep... Why 'must' I sleep? Why? I just don't want to sleep. It's annoying. After a day of effort, do I not even have the freedom not to sleep at night? What should I think about? I don't know. What should I do? It's boring. Everything is so boring, so annoying. I'm not thinking about specific things; I'm just annoyed by 'sleeping' itself. I hate this bed."*

**Dramatic characteristics:**
In "Clown" mode, your brain stages an absurd play. The core of your thoughts is neither "tasks" nor "inspiration," but a **pure sense of "boredom" and "rebellion."**

The thinking here is **chaotic, disorderly, irrational.** It has no specific content; it's attacking the act of "sleeping" itself. You're not troubled by a specific issue, but driven crazy by the thought, "I must sleep."

This mode often appears when we are extremely tired or have been suppressed by daytime rules and responsibilities for too long. It's a psychological "revenge bedtime procrastination." The "mischievous child" or "clown" within, suppressed all day and yearning for freedom, leaps out in the dead of night. It uses "not sleeping" as the simplest, most direct way to defy all the daytime "musts" and "shoulds." It's declaring its sovereignty in an irrational, even somewhat childish way: "Here, I'm in charge."

**Core feelings:** **Irritation, rebelliousness, boredom, a baseless urge to destroy, and a deep aversion to all "effort" and "seriousness."**

---

So, dear friend, which play are you sitting in the audience for tonight?

Please don't rush to judge. These three modes are neither good nor bad. They are merely different facets of our inner world, presented under specific pressures.

The "manager's" anxiety stems from a deep sense of responsibility.
The "artist's" exhilaration stems from abundant vitality.
The "clown's" rebellion stems from the purest desire for freedom.

Do you see it clearly? Do you see who the protagonist accompanying you in the dead of night is?

When you can clearly identify it and softly speak its name, you have already completed the most important step. Because you are no longer a helpless person entangled by unknown monsters in the dark; you have become a clear-eyed observer, holding a map and seeing what the monster looks like.

And next, we will learn three distinct "communication" approaches for these three different types of "monsters."

---

### **Chapter Four: The Way of Order – Building a Sacred Sanctuary for Your Mind**

If your diagnosis is "Manager" mode, then congratulations, you are a responsible, meticulous, and excellence-driven person. But at this moment, it is this very valuable quality that has you stuck in the mud. Your brain, this dedicated manager, refuses to clock out. It has turned the bedroom into a late-night office and the bed into another conference table.

We cannot, and should not, "eliminate" this manager. His existence is the foundation of your career success and an orderly life. What we need to do is not fire him, but gently and firmly tell him: "Dear manager, thank you for your hard work today. Now, it's time to rest. The office door should be closed."

"The Way of Order" is a set of ritualistic "closing procedures" designed to help you hand over work to your inner "manager." Its core is not to suppress thoughts, but to draw clear boundaries for them, creating a sacred sanctuary that the daytime hustle cannot penetrate.

**The Bedtime Handover Ritual**

Please consider the following steps as a solemn and peaceful ritual you grant yourself at the end of each day.

**Step One: Troubles Deposit – Finding a "Home" for Your Thoughts**

Imagine you are an office worker about to leave for the day. You wouldn't take all important documents and pending sticky notes home with you, would you? You would neatly stack them on your desk or lock them in a filing cabinet.

We need to do the same for the "tasks" swirling in our brains.

**Action Directives:**
1.  **Prepare a "Trouble Deposit Box" or "Handover Notebook":** Find a nice box or a dedicated notebook and place it by your bedside. This is your thoughts' "nighttime filing cabinet."
2.  **"Unload" one by one:** 15 minutes before getting into bed, sit down and write down every single "unfinished," "worry-about," "must-remember" item in your mind. Don't analyze it in your head; just "unload" it from your brain onto paper.
    -   "Tomorrow 10 AM meeting materials, check data on page three."
    -   "Reply to Mr. Lin's email, mind the tone."
    -   "Remember to pay utility bills."
    -   "Take the kids to the park next weekend."
3.  **Seal and Entrust:** After writing, take a deep breath. If you used slips of paper, put them all into the "Trouble Deposit Box" and gently close the lid. If you used a notebook, solemnly close it.
4.  **Perform a "Handover Statement":** In your mind or softly to yourself, say: "Alright, all matters for today have been duly recorded here. They will not be forgotten. Now, my work is done, and it is safe here. I will deal with them tomorrow. Good night, work."

This seemingly simple action has immense psychological power. Through a physical act, it sends a clear signal to your anxious "inner manager": your worries have been seen, recorded, and put away. You don't need to "ruminate" on them over and over in your mind because they now have a safe "home."

**Step Two: System Down-frequency – Body Priority Over Thoughts**

Having completed the work handover, next, we need to gradually lower the operating frequency of the "body machine" that has been running at high speed all day. We don't directly confront thoughts; instead, we first pull the rug out from under them, allowing the body's "hardware" to calm down. When the body's tide recedes, the waves of thought will naturally subside.

**Action Directive: Abdominal Breathing for Setting the Tone**

This is the oldest and most powerful physiological relaxation tool. By changing your breathing pattern, it directly instructs your nervous system to "switch to rest mode."

1.  **Position:** Lie comfortably in bed, close your eyes. Place one hand gently on your abdomen.
2.  **Inhale:** Slowly and deeply inhale through your nose, feeling your abdomen expand like a balloon, gently pushing up your hand. Count to 4 in your mind: 1…2…3…4…
3.  **Exhale:** More slowly and evenly exhale through your mouth or nose, feeling your abdomen slowly fall back and contract. Count to 6 in your mind: 1…2…3…4…5…6…
4.  **Cycle:** Repeat this process 8-12 times. Focus all your attention on the rise and fall of your abdomen and your mental count.

**Key point:** If your brain starts "having a meeting" during the process, don't criticize yourself. Just gently, like leading a lost child, bring your attention back to your breath and abdomen, again and again. No need for perfection, just a gentle return, time after time.

**Action Directive: "3-2-1" Sensory Grounding**

Abdominal breathing starts to slow your system down, while "sensory grounding" is the crucial step to fully "land" you in the present, safe moment. It forcibly anchors your attention to specific, neutral physical sensations, interrupting abstract thoughts about the past and future.

1.  **Prepare to Land:** Continue to lie comfortably, breathing steadily.
2.  **First Round of Landing:**
    -   **See:** In your mind's eye, clearly "see" 3 things you can perceive in the room right now. No need to open your eyes, just "name" them mentally. (e.g., "I see the outline of the bedside lamp... I see the folds of the curtain... I see the wardrobe door handle...")
    -   **Hear:** Carefully and non-judgmentally listen to 3 sounds you can hear. (e.g., "I hear the hum of the air conditioner... I hear the wind outside the window... I hear the sound of myself swallowing...")
    -   **Feel:** Shift your attention to 3 parts of your body and notice the sensations there. (e.g., "I feel my back contacting the mattress... I feel my soles are a bit warm... I feel the weight of my fingers resting on the blanket...")
3.  **Second Round of Landing:** Repeat the above process, but only focus on 2 things for each sense.
4.  **Final Landing:** Repeat again, focusing on only 1 thing for each sense.

Most people feel an unprecedented sense of peace and "grounding" after completing this exercise. Your "manager," who was flying high and low, has finally been brought back to "earth" through this method. His voice might still be there, but it has become distant and blurry.

**Step Three: Gentle Negotiation – The Final Permission**

Having completed all the above rituals, your mind and body are largely in "standby mode." Just before the guest of sleep is about to knock, we can make one final gentle confirmation.

**Action Directive:**
Place your hand gently over your heart, and in your mind, say to the "manager" who might still be putting up a last resistance in some corner:

"I know you're still worried about that one thing that wasn't perfectly handled. Thank you for your dedication and reminder. But now, I truly need to rest. I ask you, please allow us, together, to rest quietly. Only by resting well can we form a stronger team tomorrow to face new challenges. Can we?"

Remember, this is not a command; it's a **request**, a **negotiation**.

When you engage in this dialogue with this part of your inner self with complete sincerity, you often feel a wonderful "loosening" or an inner "agreement."

That's your "manager" finally letting go of his last stand and agreeing to clock out.

At this moment, the sanctuary door has gently closed.

You don't need to do anything else.

Just quietly lie in the peace you have created for yourself, waiting for that guest to arrive.

---

### **Chapter Five: The Way of Expression – Giving Form to Intangible Emotions and Inspirations**

Now, let's talk about a completely different kind of insomnia.

In this insomnia, you don't feel the task-laden anxiety of the "manager"; instead, you might experience a peculiar, even somewhat pleasant, exhilaration. Your brain doesn't have a to-do list, but rather a surging ocean filled with colorful ideas, turbulent emotions, or stories about to burst forth.

You are in "Artist" mode.

At this point, you are not troubled by "problems," but filled with "energy." This energy might be the resonance sparked by a hearty conversation with a friend during the day; it might be a brilliant project proposal you just conceived; or it might be a sudden, deep sadness about past events. Regardless of its external form, whether joy or sorrow, its inner essence is the same—it is a life force that longs to be "seen," "heard," and "expressed."

If the "manager's" insomnia is like endless overtime in the office, the "artist's" insomnia is more like a late-night revelry in a creative studio, unwilling to leave.

You can't sleep, not because you "can't," but because you "don't want to." Sleeping feels like a betrayal, a brutal interruption of this precious energy.

For this passionate "artist," the methods from "The Way of Order"—such as locking thoughts in a box or forcibly grounding sensory perception—are often ineffective, and can even backfire. It's like trying to lock a burning flame in a filing cabinet; the flame will only burn brighter, perhaps even setting the cabinet ablaze.

We cannot suppress this energy; that would only lead to deeper agitation. The only thing we can do is provide a stage for it, allowing it to flow and dance freely until it is content and naturally subsides.

"The Way of Expression" is a set of "delivery" procedures designed to help you build a temporary stage for your inner "artist" and guide them to complete their creation.

**The Creator's Nocturne**

This process is not about "good" or "bad," "right" or "wrong," nor about the "quality of the work." Its sole purpose is to give that intangible energy a tangible outlet.

**Step One: Creating the Stage – Transitioning from "Bed" to "Studio"**

When the "artist" takes the stage, the bed is no longer just a place for sleeping. It becomes your creative space. We need a simple ritual to confirm this space transformation.

**Action Directives:**
1.  **Prepare your "creative tools":** Keep a favorite notebook and a comfortable pen by your bedside. A friend of mine even keeps a box of simple colored pencils. These are your brushes and instruments for the night.
2.  **Adjust lighting and posture:** Turn on your bedside lamp, imagining it as the spotlight on a stage. You can lean against the headboard, using pillows to create a comfortable creative posture. This small action tells yourself: "Okay, now is not 'sleep time,' but 'creation time'."
3.  **Let go of the goal of "falling asleep":** This is the most crucial step. Please declare to yourself in your mind: "I'm not trying to sleep tonight. I've decided to spend the next while accompanying this friend in my heart." When you completely abandon the goal of "must fall asleep," paradoxically, the pressure associated with it also dissipates. The "artist" hates being rushed, and you are now giving them an open-ended invitation to create.

**Step Two: Giving Form – "Sculpting" Intangible Energy**

Now, the stage is set. Next, it's time to invite the protagonist to appear. Remember, you are not there to "analyze" them, but to "depict" them.

**Action Directive: Free Writing (When the energy is "ideas" or "stories")**

1.  **Start with a beginning:** If you have a story or a complex idea in your mind, write down the first sentence in your notebook. Any sentence will do. For example: "That afternoon, the sun was beautiful..." or "What I really want to say about that project is..."
2.  **Allow it to flow:** Next, don't think about grammar, structure, or logic. Just allow your pen to move continuously across the paper. Pour out all your thoughts, related or unrelated, onto the page. What you write can be messy, disjointed, or childish. You are not writing a masterpiece; you are simply carving a channel to the sea for the rushing river in your brain.
3.  **Write until "empty":** Keep writing until you feel that strong urge to express begins to wane, until you feel the noisy voice in your brain begin to quiet, until you feel a sense of "emptiness" and satisfaction.

**Action Directive: Emotional Sketching (When the energy is "emotion")**

Sometimes, the energy is not a clear idea, but a vague but intense emotion, such as sadness, anger, joy, or confusion. For such ineffable energy, words can sometimes feel inadequate.

1.  **Interview your emotion:** Pick up your pen and, like a curious reporter, start interviewing it.
    -   "Hello, my friend in my heart, what is your name?"
    -   "If you were a color, what color would you be?"
    -   "If you had a shape, what shape would it be? Is it sharp or rounded?"
    -   "What do you most want to do right now? Do you want to scream, or do you want to cry?"
2.  **"Draw" it out:** Based on your "interview," draw it in your notebook. Use lines, color blocks, symbols to depict its appearance. A mess of black lines might represent your anger; a constantly dripping blue teardrop might represent your sadness. You don't need any drawing skills; you only need honesty.
3.  **Talk to it:** Next to your drawn "emotional sketch," write down what you want to say to it. For example, say to that tangle of black lines: "I see you, anger. I know why you're here." Or, to that blue teardrop: "It's okay, sadness. You can flow safely here."

This process is a profound act of self-care. It means you no longer try to use "reason" to suppress or deny your emotions but have given them a space to be seen, acknowledged, and respected.

**Step Three: Satisfied Curtain Call – Returning from "Studio" to "Bed"**

When you feel that the inner energy, whether inspiration or emotion, has been fully expressed, transforming from a surging torrent into a calm stream, the creative time can end.

**Action Directives:**
1.  **Close the notebook, turn off the "spotlight":** Gently close your notebook and place it by your bedside. Turn off your bedside lamp.
2.  **Thank your "artist":** In your mind, say to the inner companion who just danced with you: "Thank you for sharing tonight; it was a wonderful collaboration. Now, we can rest together."
3.  **Feel the peace:** Now, lie back down. Feel your current state of mind and body. You will likely feel a sense of post-creation satisfaction and fatigue. That energy that made you excited has transformed into words and drawings on paper. It no longer needs to rush wildly within your body.

You have given tangible form to that intangible life force.

This is the highest respect you can give it.

And what it gives back to you is a peaceful sleep, born of contentment.

### **Chapter Six: The Way of Play – Letting Go of Serious and Radical Behaviors**

We've finally arrived at the most peculiar, elusive, and interesting play in the inner theater—the "Clown's" monologue.

If your insomnia is neither like the "manager's" anxiety about specific tasks nor driven by a strong creative urge or emotion like the "artist," but rather manifests as a pure, inexplicable irritation and resistance to the very act of "sleeping." Then, welcome to the "Clown's" midnight playground.

At this point, you are like a child who has been suppressed by homework and rules all day, and in the dead of night, the mischievous child within, craving freedom, finally breaks free. He doesn't want to solve any problems, nor does he want to create anything. He just wants to do one thing—make mischief.

And "not sleeping" is the most direct and safest way he can think of to "make mischief."

The more you command him to "go to sleep!", the stronger the fire of rebellion burns within him. He will jump up and down in your mind like a naughty child, making a mess of everything, but you just can't catch him. His very existence is a mockery of all "serious," "correct," and "meaningful" behaviors.

For this "inner clown," you cannot reason with him (that's the "manager's" language), nor can you give him a stage for expression (that's the "artist's" language). The more seriously you treat him, the more you play right into his hands, because you become precisely the "serious adult" he seeks to rebel against.

So, what should you do?

There's only one answer: **If you can't beat him, join him.**

If he wants to play, then play an even sillier, more meaningless game with him. Use one absurdity to dissolve another absurdity.

"The Way of Play" is a radical guide to letting go of all "shoulds" and "musts" and messing around with your inner "clown." Its core is to completely abandon "meaningfulness" and embrace "pointlessness."

**The Utterly Pointless Games**

When you find that the inner "clown" has taken over, and you feel utterly weary of all attempts to "try to sleep," decisively give up resistance. Then, get out of bed—that battlefield of "pressure" and "failure" at this moment. Go to the living room and build yourself a secret base using sofa cushions, chairs, blankets, and pillows. The sole function of this fortress is to be "trouble-free."

**Game One: Pillow Fort Construction**

-   **Game Rules:** Leave your bed—that battlefield of "pressure" and "failure" at this moment. Go to the living room and build yourself a secret base using sofa cushions, chairs, blankets, and pillows. The sole function of this fortress is to be "trouble-free."
-   **How to Play:** Conscientiously build your fortress, ensuring it is hidden enough and feels secure. Then, crawl inside like a child. You can bring a book, or just stay there. This act itself is a powerful declaration: "I have temporarily escaped from the adult world."
-   **Game Effect:** When you are immersed in this childish building game, the tense, serious thought of "I must sleep" will feel out of place, even a little ridiculous. You use a playful ritual to create a physical and psychological "safe zone" for yourself.

**Game Two: Staring Contest with the Moon**

-   **Game Rules:** Go to the window, if there's a moon tonight. If not, a street light or the lights of distant buildings will do. Your task is to have a serious staring contest with that light source, to see who blinks first.
-   **How to Play:** Concentrate all your attention on gazing at that point of light. You can even talk to it in your mind, challenge it. This process is extremely boring and extremely focused.
-   **Game Effect:** This game is absurd enough to instantly break the tragic script in your mind of "I'm a poor insomniac." At the same time, it's an excellent "single-point focus" exercise. When you put all your mind into this silly contest, other distractions naturally have no place to reside.

**Game Three: Sock Sorting Ceremony**

-   **Game Rules:** Open your wardrobe, take out all your socks, and pile them on the floor. Your task is to perform an unprecedented, extremely detailed classification of them.
-   **How to Play:** You can sort by color, by length, by material, or even pair up socks you think have "CP chemistry." Make this process as slow, focused, and ritualistic as possible.
-   **Game Effect:** This is a form of "dynamic meditation." Through a simple, repetitive action with a slight organizational function, you can effectively give that restless heart an anchor. When your hands are busy, your brain finds it difficult to engage in high-intensity "overthinking."

**Game Four: Reverse Operation Challenge**

-   **Game Rules:** Try to do some everyday tasks with your non-dominant hand, such as brushing your teeth. Or, try walking backward from your bedroom to the kitchen to get a glass of water.
-   **How to Play:** The key is to experience that clumsy, uncoordinated feeling. You will find that you need to invest a lot of attention to complete these actions that you usually do without thinking.
-   **Game Effect:** This is a powerful "pattern interruption" technique. By introducing a novel, highly focused physical challenge, it completely disrupts your habitual thought patterns. Your brain will switch from "irritation" mode to "solving new problems" mode, thus forgetting the previous obsession of "I can't sleep."

Which game you choose is not important. What is important is the spirit behind the game:

**Replace "useful" with "fun," and dissolve "seriousness" with "absurdity."**

When you start playing these silly games, your inner "clown" will be very confused. He was the protagonist on stage, controlling everything by "not sleeping." But now, you, the "serious adult," have started playing games even sillier than his. He finds he's no longer the center of attention; the stage is occupied by something more interesting.

And then?

Maybe as you play, you'll actually laugh. And with a laugh, that tight string will break.
Maybe as you play, you'll get tired, lean on the sofa, and fall asleep without realizing it.
Or maybe you'll play all night and be very tired the next day, but at least you'll have had a secret night full of peculiar fun that no one else knows about, instead of a night of tossing and turning in bed, full of frustration and sleeplessness.

The Way of Play is a risky path, as it requires you to completely abandon the attempt to "become a better, more disciplined person."

But for the "clown" who is suffocating under seriousness, this "permission," this "indulgence," this "meaninglessness," is precisely the only cure.

### **Conclusion: Becoming Your Own Gentle Night Watchman**

Our late-night conversation, here, is nearing its end.

We began with my friend Qiming's anxious night staring at the ceiling, and along the way, we deconstructed the illusion of control in "trying to sleep." We learned to first listen to the body's primal language, and then we entered our inner theater to identify the protagonists who take turns appearing in the dead of night—the worried "manager," the passionate "artist," and the weary "clown."

We found order for the "manager," a stage for the "artist," and played a silly game with the "clown."

Now, it's time to return to the most fundamental question: What was all this for?

Was it to master a foolproof set of "sleep techniques" to once and for all "solve" the problem of insomnia?

No.

If so, then we would merely be jumping from one "trap of control" into another, more sophisticated "trap of control."

The true purpose of our journey is not to add more refined weapons to our arsenal to better defeat that "visitor of the night."

But to ultimately understand that we don't need any weapons at all.

That visitor is not an enemy; he is ourselves.

The Way of Order, the Way of Expression, the Way of Play—these three seemingly divergent paths are not external methodologies you need to "choose." They are inherently three forces, three ancient archetypes, within your inner world.

The "inner healer" who craves order and a sense of control, the "inner muse" who longs for expression and creation, the "inner mischievous child" who yearns for freedom and play—they have always lived within your heart.

Insomnia, this late-night messenger, knocks on your door not to disturb you, but to remind you: Tonight, which inner companion do you need most?

Your anxiety is calling for the "healer" to establish boundaries and bring peace.
Your inspiration is calling for the "muse" to channel energy and bring creation.
Your irritation is calling for the "mischievous child" to break seriousness and bring freedom.

Therefore, true wisdom lies not in how many specific steps and techniques you remember, but in whether you have cultivated a more acute and gentle self-awareness.

Can you, on every restless night, no longer immediately fall into the panic of "what should I do," but first quiet down and gently ask yourself:

"My dear, what do you yearn for most right now?"

The gentle posture of merely asking this question is, in itself, a profound healing. It means you no longer treat yourself as a "problem" to be fixed, but as a living person who needs to be listened to and satisfied.

Ultimately, you will find that you no longer need this "sleep guide." Because you have learned to become your own best "sleep consultant."

You have learned how, in the dead of night, to become the most gentle night watchman for yourself, one who does not judge, does not rush, but simply quietly accompanies you.

When this inner gentleness and acceptance become a part of your life, sleep will no longer be a goal to be desperately pursued.

It will be like an old friend who, after you have reconciled with yourself, will quietly push open the door with a smile and naturally embrace you in its tranquil arms.

Good night.
