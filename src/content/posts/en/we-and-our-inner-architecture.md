### Prologue: Runners on a Carousel

We seem to live in a great paradox.

On the one hand, we possess more "solutions" than any other era in human history. Our phones are filled with apps designed to maximize efficiency every minute; our bookmarks hold countless fitness tutorials, financial courses, and communication tips; we can easily access detailed guides on how to meditate, how to organize our rooms, how to become a more popular person. Theoretically, we should be closer than ever to that ideal life of ease, self-sufficiency, and inner abundance.

But on the other hand, a pervasive, diffuse anxiety permeates the air of our time like vapor. We feel... tired. A deep fatigue, not entirely proportionate to the physical effort we exert.

We are like a group of runners on a carousel.

The music is stirring, the lights are dazzling, and each of us, on our magnificent carousel horse, is vigorously moving our legs, sweating profusely. From an outsider's perspective, we appear graceful and vibrant, as if we are galloping towards a bright future. But only we ourselves know that no matter how fast or how hard we run, the distance between us and that horse will never shorten by a centimeter. We are breathless, yet perpetually spinning in place.

Many such "runners" surround me; they are my dear friends, and a true microcosm of this era.

Some are "efficiency addicts." Their schedules are like intricate circuit diagrams, every time block meticulously filled with a task. They wrap themselves tightly in the heavy cloak of "busyness," because they fear that if they stop, they will feel the chilling wind of "emptiness." Busyness has become their only weapon against a sense of meaninglessness.

Some are "knowledge anxious." Their hard drives are stocked with thousands of gigabytes of course materials, and their bookmark lists are as long as a snake. They are obsessed with "input," believing that if they just learn a little more, understand a little more, they will find the ultimate answer to all problems. But they rarely "output," rarely start. Because hoarding knowledge provides a false sense of security, and once they start practicing, they must confront the risk of potentially being "not good enough."

And then there are the "life cosplayers." They are like skilled actors, expertly switching between different masks in various social settings—the corporate elite, the filial child, the interesting friend, the devoted partner. Each facade is almost perfect, meeting everyone's expectations. But they rarely take the time to ask themselves: after shedding all these costumes, who is the plain-faced "me" standing in front of the mirror?

These portraits may feel familiar to you. Because, to varying degrees, we are all playing one of these roles, or exhausting ourselves bouncing between them. We try so hard, yet are so confused.

This predicament of "spinning in place" may stem from the fact that all our efforts are happening on the wrong level.

Let's use another metaphor. Imagine our inner world as an invisible, complex building. Each of us has such a building within.

And most of the time, all our struggles, efforts, and changes occur in the bustling, public hall on the first floor. If we feel anxious, we change the wall color to a brighter one (change a hobby); if we feel dissatisfied, we replace the sofa with a more expensive brand (change jobs); if we feel lonely, we throw more lively parties (increase social interaction). We believe that if we just arrange the first-floor hall perfectly enough, all problems will be solved.

But we rarely consider that the problem might not be on the first floor at all.

Perhaps the building's basement is perpetually cold and damp, and the echoes of childhood we deliberately forgot are quietly eroding the entire building's foundation.

Perhaps the yellowed blueprint in the second-floor study is long outdated, and the family rules and societal beliefs about "how one should be" and "what one cannot do," which we have never questioned, are limiting all our possibilities.

Perhaps we have even forgotten that the top floor of this building has an attic skylight from which we can gaze at the stars. We haven't looked up in so long that we've forgotten the stars exist.

This article is not trying to give you a faster horse so you can run more easily on the carousel. No, it wants to invite you, along with me, to first step off this damn carousel.

Let's catch our breath.

Then, with a flashlight, a bit of curiosity, and perhaps a little courage to face dust and darkness, let's explore our own inner architecture—this building that is both most familiar and most foreign. We will learn together how to read its blueprints, understand its structure, and listen to the echoes from every corner.

This is not a violent demolition and reconstruction project, but a gentle and profound journey of self-discovery.

Ready?

Then, let's start from the basement.

### **Part One: The Building's Blueprint: Seeing the Invisible Forces That Shape Us**

#### **Chapter One: The Foundation: Why Are We So Obsessed with "Origin Theory"?**

So, our exploration begins in a place we usually least want to visit: the basement.

In a real building, the foundation and basement are parts that ordinary visitors rarely see. They are usually dimly lit, sometimes cold and damp, and filled with miscellaneous items we prefer not to deal with frequently in daily life. However, it is these unseen parts that determine the stability of the entire building and the height it can ultimately reach. Our inner architecture is no different. The basement and foundation of this building represent the "Environmental Level" of our thinking—the initial world into which we were passively and indiscriminately cast.

Have you noticed an interesting phenomenon? In recent years, discussions in public discourse about "native families," "class solidification," and "regional differences" have almost become a prominent field of study. If we rewind ten years, we seemed more willing to believe in heroic narratives of individuals who, through personal struggle, went from rags to riches. But now, we seem to have collectively developed an "archaeological癖," eager to dig into our origins, trying to understand how we grew into who we are today from the root.

We analyze parental marriage patterns and how they influence our current intimate relationships; we explore childhood material conditions and how they shaped our inner sense of security; we even debate how the temperament of a city defines the collective personality of its locals.

This is not making a fuss over nothing. In my opinion, this shift in public discourse is, in itself, a profound, collective "awakening." We are beginning to realize that we are not abstract individuals floating in a vacuum with unlimited free will. We are more like plants, and the soil in which we are rooted—barren or fertile, dry or wet—profoundly affects our growth, posture, and even the kind of fruit we eventually bear.

This soil is the "Environmental Level."

It was the "all trades are inferior, only studying is superior" humidity in a friend's childhood home. She had extraordinary talent for painting, but in that family atmosphere where pragmatism reigned supreme, this talent became an inconvenient, even somewhat shameful, "peculiarity." Her parents might not have meant harm, simply habitually sighing, "What's the use of painting these? Can it feed you?" This sentence became the perpetual, sticky dampness in the basement of her inner architecture, making all her creativity feel sluggish. Many years later, even when she was already making a living from painting and gaining some renown, whenever she picked up a brush, that slight sense of guilt, "I'm doing something improper," would still rise quietly like a ghost from the dark corners of the basement.

It was also the "background noise" another friend experienced in his first job. It was a rigidly hierarchical traditional company where everyone spoke cautiously, and the CC list for reporting emails was like a mysterious art that needed careful consideration. No one stated it explicitly, but everyone adhered to an unspoken set of rules. Over time, he internalized this oppressive, wary communication style as a professional instinct. So much so that when he later moved to an open-minded internet company, for a long time, he couldn't adapt to direct, frank conversations. He always felt it was "unsafe," like a trap. He brought the basement noise into his new building.

This is the power of the "Environmental Level." It sets the initial parameters for our lives. It is not a cold, deterministic verdict, but it is certainly a very powerful "recommendation." It whispers in our ears, telling us what is possible, what is safe, and what is an "impractical fantasy."

The same logic applies not only to individuals but also perfectly to an organization, a system.

Why do some startups, even with huge investments and top talent, still have the feel of a "small workshop"? Because the founding team's "basement"—their early formed personal relationships, communication habits, and original attitudes toward risk—has already solidified into the company's foundation. I once briefly worked at a company where the two founders were college roommates and very close. Their communication style was full of "inside jokes" only they understood and unspoken默契. When the company had only a dozen people, this was an efficient, family-like "basement culture."

But when the company expanded to two hundred people, this foundation began to groan. New executives, like "stepchildren" trying to fit into a large family, could never truly understand the founders' "inside jokes"; important decisions were often made during what seemed like casual dinners between the two, leaving the executing teams at a loss; a subtle barrier of "insiders" and "outsiders" permeated the company. This foundation, built on intimate "brotherhood," simply could not support the stable and transparent governance structure required by a modern enterprise.

The most dangerous characteristic of the "Environmental Level" is that it often appears as the "sole reality," causing us to lose our imagination for other possibilities. The girl who loved painting would genuinely start to believe that pursuing art was "improper"; the employees of that company would genuinely think that chaotic and disorderly communication was "the norm for startups." We too easily mistake our own basement for the entire world.

Therefore, the first action in our exploration journey is a small, but crucial, intellectual "rebellion": to switch on a light in our basement.

This light is "distinction."

Distinguishing "the facts of the environment" from "the story we tell about these facts."

The fact might be: your parents rarely praised you; your company's processes are indeed chaotic. And the story is the meaning we give to these facts: "**Therefore,** I am destined to be an unconfident person"; "**Therefore,** this company is beyond saving." Facts are bricks, and stories are the cages we build for ourselves with these bricks.

Turning on this light is not to find someone to blame, nor to lament our damp past like Xianglin's Wife.

No, it is for "understanding."

It is to clearly see from which pipe's crack that dampness is leaking. Once we see it clearly, we can have genuine choice—whether to repair that crack, or install a powerful dehumidifier, or open a ventilating skylight in the basement, or even, after careful evaluation, decide to "move," to lay a new foundation on drier, sunnier ground.

The first step to becoming the architect of our inner world is to first become a clear-headed, honest, and empathetic geological explorer of ourselves.

We must first clearly see the ground we stand on, and only then can we talk about the sky garden we dream of building.
#### **Chapter Two: The First Floor: Why Have We Fallen into "Performative" Busyness?**

If the basement is the private, often overlooked space of our inner architecture concerning "past" and "origins," then the first-floor hall is the completely public place concerning "present" and "presentation"—where we invest the most effort in decorating and maintaining.

Here is the stage for the "Behavioral Level."

Our daily rushing, working, studying, socializing, exercising, entertaining... all those visible, recordable, quantifiable "what we do" or "what we don't do" play out in this hall. This is our storefront to the world, and our primary venue for interacting with others. We invest most of our time and energy here, believing that as long as our actions are correct enough, diligent enough, and efficient enough, we can build this hall into what we desire.

Consequently, in our era, a peculiar, almost religiously fervent "worship of behavior" has emerged.

We worship "996" not because we genuinely love endless work, but because this high-intensity "behavior" itself has become a badge proving our "value" and "struggle." We worship "involution" not because we enjoy an arms race over trivial details, but because the "behavior" of "working harder than others" can temporarily alleviate our deep fear of "being eliminated." We are keen on "checking in" on social media—showing off workout records, late-night office photos, books we are reading—we are so obsessed with recording and displaying these "behaviors," sometimes even more than the experience these behaviors bring us.

We seem to have collectively fallen into a "performative" busyness.

I have a friend who is a fervent believer in "planning." His planner is more detailed than some national legal codes. He cuts his day into fifteen-minute modules, then uses different colored highlighters to mark the "behaviors" to be completed in each module. Running five kilometers, reading thirty pages of a professional book, replying to all work emails, meditating for ten minutes... His life seems like a precisely calibrated Swiss clock, every second operating with high efficiency.

Once, I couldn't help but ask him, "Can you really complete all of it? Don't you get tired?"

He gave a wry smile and said something that left a deep impression on me: "Of course, I can't complete it all. But you don't know, just the 'act' of writing down these plans, that 'behavior' itself, makes me feel much better. It makes me feel like my life is controllable, that I'm moving forward, not losing control and falling."

I understood him instantly.

What he was fascinated by was not the actual results that those behaviors could bring, but the "false sense of control" that the behaviors of "planning" and "executing" themselves could provide. This first-floor hall was decorated by him with dense behavioral plans, like a well-ordered palace. But this orderliness was precisely to cover up the uncontrollable chaos and disorder in a room upstairs.

This is the trap of the "Behavioral Level." We too easily equate "action" itself with "growth" or "problem-solving."

In organizations, this trap is even more common.

Why do so many large companies fall into an "ocean of meetings"? Holding a meeting is a typical organizational "behavior." When a problem arises, the simplest, safest "behavior" is, "Let's have a meeting to discuss it." So, the conference room is full of people, PPT slides are flipped page by page, everyone seems to be actively participating, but few dare to make real decisions or take real responsibility. The "behavior" of holding meetings becomes a collective performance of "we are actively trying to solve problems," successfully masking the organization's unclear responsibilities, vague strategies, or lack of conviction at higher levels.

Why are so many companies keen on "campaign-style" reforms? Today, we all learn "OKR," tomorrow we introduce "Agile development," the day after tomorrow we'll launch "digital transformation." These are all grand "renovation projects" in the first-floor hall. Management promotes these trendy "behaviors" and "tools" to demonstrate to both external and internal stakeholders that "we are actively changing." But if the building's blueprints (beliefs and strategies) remain unchanged, these noisy behaviors will ultimately leave nothing but a mess, draining valuable employee energy and trust.

We must clearly recognize that "behavior" is merely a result, not a cause. It is only a symptom, not the root of the illness.

Someone who procrastinates on a new project due to fear of failure (behavior: procrastination) might not need a more perfect project plan (another behavior), but rather a long talk with the "I'm not good enough" belief (Belief Level) in the room upstairs filled with self-doubt.

Someone who habitually communicates with blame and complaints in intimate relationships (behavior: arguing) might not need to learn certain "non-violent communication" techniques (Capability Level), but rather to examine whether, in their inner architecture, "vulnerability" is wrongly equated with "danger" or "failure" (Belief Level).

This is not to say that changing behavior is unimportant. On the contrary, behavior is our most direct way of interacting with the world, and the ultimate point of all change. However, if we only spin around in the first-floor hall, using one behavior to correct another, using one kind of busyness to mask another kind of emptiness, then we will always just be running harder on the carousel.

So, for our exploration of the first-floor hall, the questions we need to ask ourselves are:

Are my current behaviors "building" or "consuming"?

Are my seemingly diligent actions truly solving problems, or are they cleverly "avoiding" a deeper, more frightening problem?

Am I making a documentary of my life, or am I taking a beautiful-looking screenshot for my social media?

When we begin to examine every action in the first-floor hall with such "awareness," we truly begin to transform from an "actor" into an "architect."

#### **Chapter Three: The Second Floor: Why Do We So Worship "Methodology"?**

Ascending the stairs from the first floor to the second, we move from the noisy stage of "what to do" actions to a relatively quiet, professional space of "how to do."

Here is the domain of the "Capability Level." It is our private "workshop" and "arsenal."

In this room, everything we have acquired through learning and practice is neatly arranged: our diplomas, professional qualifications, driving skills, foreign language proficiency, programming abilities, public speaking techniques, cooking skills... all those things that can be written under the "skills" section of a resume shine here.

This is a room full of power and certainty. The dampness and origins of the basement are too distant; the busyness and performance of the first-floor hall are too draining. But this room on the second floor is so concrete, so reliable. Every time we learn a new skill, master a new tool, it's as if we're adding a brand new, powerful weapon to this room. This feeling of "I can do it" is so alluring that in our era, the worship of "capability" has almost reached a new peak.

We are keen to talk about various "methodologies." From "Feynman learning technique" to "Pyramid Principle," from "Pomodoro Technique" to "GTD," we are like a group of players eager to upgrade their equipment, frantically collecting these "dragon-slaying arts" that can make us smarter, more efficient, and more persuasive. We participate in various bootcamps, purchase various online courses, firmly believing that as long as our "arsenal" is sufficiently stocked, we can handle all challenges in life.

Of course, there is truth in this. Without the "Capability" bridge, any grand ideas generated on higher floors cannot be translated into effective "behaviors" in the first-floor hall. A person with educational passion but no teaching methods cannot be a good teacher; a company with a grand vision but lacking core technology can only be a daydreamer.

But the problem is, we too easily overestimate the boundaries of "capability," even falling into a "capability illusion"—believing that mastering all hammers can solve all problems.

I know a very excellent lawyer friend whose logical reasoning ability is one of the best I've ever seen. In his professional field, he can easily find any tiny flaw in an opponent's argument and then deliver a fatal blow with precise language. He considers this set of "capabilities" his invincible sword.

But the trouble is, he brought this sword home.

In arguments with his partner, he habitually used this set of "capabilities." He would keenly catch logical contradictions in the other's words, then corner them with a series of irrefutable counter-questions until they were speechless. Each time, he "won" the debate, but he felt he was slowly "losing" the relationship. His partner didn't need a logically impeccable "opponent," but a "teammate" who could empathize with her emotions. But his overly sharp "sword of capability" automatically switched all intimate conversations into "debate mode."

This is the paradox of "capability." When we excessively rely on and identify with a particular capability we are proud of, that capability can transform from a "tool" into a "filter," or even a "cage." It will filter the way we view the world and limit our ability to respond in other ways.

A manager skilled in data analysis might unconsciously overlook important, unquantifiable information about team emotions and morale. A "strong person" accustomed to solving all problems independently might lose the "ability to ask for help" when they genuinely need it.

At the organizational level, this "capability curse" is exemplified by the famous "Kodak tragedy."

Today, when we review Kodak's story, there's often a misunderstanding that it was eliminated by the times because of technological backwardness, not mastering digital technology (capability). But the truth is quite the opposite: the world's first digital camera was invented by a Kodak engineer in 1975. Kodak's second-floor "arsenal" not only had this weapon, but it was built by their own hands.

So where was the problem?

The problem was upstairs. Kodak's "identity" (fourth floor) was "the world's best film manufacturer"; its core "belief" (third floor) was "people need to print photos to preserve memories." This overly successful identity and belief created a powerful gravitational field. In this field, the digital camera, this "new species," though born in Kodak's "capability" workshop, was from the beginning regarded as an "anomaly," a "monster" that threatened its core identity and beliefs.

Kodak's management wasn't blind to the future of digital technology; rather, the structure of their inner architecture dictated that they couldn't truly embrace this future. All their decisions attempted to twist this "new capability" into the old belief framework of "selling film and printing photos." Ultimately, they were killed by the weapon they created but dared not truly use.

Kodak's tragedy serves as the most profound warning to all "capability worshippers": the fate of a building is ultimately not determined by how advanced its second-floor toolkit is, but by the blueprints and the soul of the building on the third and fourth floors.

So, for our exploration of the second floor, we need to vigilantly ask ourselves:

What is my most proud, most frequently used "capability"?
While this capability helps me solve problems, does it also limit my other perspectives on the world?
Have I, by over-relying on a certain "hammer," overlooked problems that need to be gently touched by hand?
Am I actively "using" my capability, or am I unconsciously "serving" my capability, being dragged along by it?

When we begin to reflect on these questions, we start to evolve from a mere "craftsman" to a wiser "designer." A good designer not only knows how to use tools but also knows when to put them down.
#### **Chapter Four: The Third Floor: Those "Unspoken Rules" We Never Questioned**

Stepping out of the powerful workshop on the second floor, filled with "tools" and "weapons," we arrive at the third floor. This area is usually dimly lit, exceptionally quiet, and the air carries the scent of old paper and ink.

Here is the "Beliefs and Values" level. It is the archive of the entire inner architecture's blueprints and building codes.

Unlike the visible and tangible "behaviors" and "capabilities" downstairs, everything on this floor is intangible. It is not open to the public, and even we ourselves rarely choose to enter it. Yet, it is the dusty "blueprints" and "regulations" in this room, often overlooked, that silently and absolutely control everything downstairs.

They are our inner "unspoken rules."

These unspoken rules appear as "self-evident," "natural," so much so that we rarely question their existence. They are like the background code running our operating system; we don't see them, but they define the boundaries and permissions of all our foreground operations.

Let's explore a few common, highly representative "unspoken rules."

For example, for one of my friends, the first rule in her inner architecture's code is written in bold black letters: "Never trouble others."

This rule, at first glance, seems like a virtue—considerate, independent, empathetic. For many years, she indeed earned praise for being "reliable" and "capable" in her work and life because of it. She was like a silent, omnipotent "problem solver," quietly bearing all pressure. She helped colleagues with their messes; she readily met family needs; she carefully nurtured her partner's emotions. She never actively asked for help, nor did she easily expose her vulnerability.

But in recent years, this building began to sound alarms. She felt like a sponge about to be squeezed dry, physically and mentally exhausted. At work, she missed many promotion opportunities because she didn't know how to manage up and ask for help; in intimate relationships, she felt like a functional "nanny" rather than a loved "partner" because she never expressed her true needs.

That unspoken rule, "don't trouble others," which was once her "armor" protecting her and earning her praise, had now become a suffocating, airtight "prison uniform."

Like detectives, we traced the origin of this rule together. Finally, during an afternoon chat, she recalled a small childhood incident she had long forgotten. When she was about five or six, she had a high fever in the middle of the night, and her parents rushed her to the hospital. In the hospital corridor, she vaguely heard her mother sigh to her father, "This child, she's really a bother."

Just such a seemingly unintentional, tired complaint was taken by a sensitive child as a sacred, inviolable "rule for survival," and it was etched into the regulations of her inner architecture. Because in a child's world, "troubling parents" was almost equivalent to "possibly being abandoned." To ensure her "safety," she had to become a "trouble-free," sensible child.

This unspoken rule has thus been running in the background for decades.

Another common unspoken rule is: "Stability trumps everything."

This rule was almost foundational in the architecture of our parents' generation. Having experienced material scarcity and turbulent times, they viewed "stability" as the most important "ballast" for the ship of life. This belief was also passed down through words and actions, written into the inner rules of many people.

So we see so many talented young people, clearly bored with their current jobs, yet afraid to cross the line for fear of losing this "stability." They will use a hundred reasons to convince themselves: "The economy is bad now," "I have a mortgage and car loan," "Just bear with it a little longer." These are "rational analyses" from the first and second floors, but what truly immobilizes them is the immovable rule on the third floor called "stability trumps everything."

At the organizational level, the power of such "unspoken rules" is what we call "corporate culture."

A company's walls might be plastered with slogans like "Innovation," "Embrace Change" (first-floor behavioral advocacy), and the company might have spent a fortune hiring a consulting firm to provide detailed innovation process training (second-floor capability building). However, if the company's "unspoken rule" is "the nail that sticks out gets hammered down" or "more work, more mistakes; less work, fewer mistakes," then no matter how lively the renovation project downstairs, ultimately no employee will dare to propose truly disruptive ideas.

Because everyone implicitly knows that what determines your survival in this building is not the slogans on the wall, but the invisible, true "rulebook" on the third floor.

Therefore, exploring the third floor of our inner architecture is an extremely important and challenging task. It requires us to be like archaeologists, carefully brushing away the thick dust covering the belief blueprints.

We need to ask ourselves with genuine curiosity:

In my life, are there any "self-evident" "shoulds" and "should nots" that I have never questioned?
What were these rules originally intended to protect me from? Have they truly helped me in the past?
Today, are they still nourishing me, or have they become a limitation?
If I could, like amending a contract clause, modify one of them, what would I change?

When we begin this conversation, we start to try and become a "developer" with backend access, rather than a "user" silently controlled by backend code. We might not be able to rewrite the entire operating system immediately, but at least we can install a "pop-up blocker" plugin for ourselves, giving us a chance to "choose" whether to click "agree" when those old, restrictive unspoken rules automatically pop up again.

### **Part Two: The Building's Soul: Anchoring the Self in Identity, Mission, and Meaning**

#### **Chapter Five: The Fourth Floor: How Do We Answer "Who Am I?"**

If the study on the third floor houses the building's "regulations," then the fourth floor is the "owner"—or rather, the "resident"—of this building, the core of their self-identity.

Here is the "Identity Level." It is the soul center of the entire building.

This question—"Who am I?"—sounds incredibly grand, even a bit impractical. In our daily hustle, we rarely question ourselves so directly, so nakedly. But in reality, we are constantly answering this question with our actions and choices. We label ourselves, or passively accept various "identity tags," and then build our lives around these tags.

"I am a responsible son."
"I am a diligent and ambitious employee."
"I am an introvert."
"I am a rational, emotionally stable person."
"I am an ordinary person with no special talent."

These tags are the "core furniture" in our fourth-floor living room. They define the "style" of this living room and determine the posture in which we "exist" within it.

In the early stages of life, these identity tags are crucial for us. They are like thick coats, providing us with initial warmth, security, and a sense of belonging. A child who strives to play the role of a "top student" in school gains the affection of teachers and the respect of classmates through this label. A new employee who tries their best to be a "reliable colleague" wins the trust and acceptance of the team through this label.

These identities were once our "shelters."

But as life unfolds, these former shelters often slowly turn into our "prisons."

I have a senior colleague whose identity for the first half of his life was almost synonymous with "success." Graduating from a prestigious university, he rose steadily in a large company, becoming an executive in his early forties. The living room on the fourth floor of his inner architecture was splendidly decorated, with a huge, gold-framed plaque hanging in the center, inscribed with: "I am a winner." This identity drove all the lower floors of his building to operate efficiently: he believed in "no pain, no gain" (Belief), he learned all knowledge that could make him "win" (Capability), and he put in extraordinary effort for it (Behavior).

However, a few years ago, due to an internal power struggle in the company, he was forced to resign. At that moment, he said, he felt "the sky had fallen."

After a deep conversation, we found that what truly "fell" was not his career, nor even his financial resources. What truly fell was that "winner" plaque in his fourth-floor living room. When the external environment (basement) drastically changed and could no longer support this core identity, his entire inner architecture experienced a violent "earthquake." He fell into a year-long depression, because he didn't know, if "I" was no longer that "winner," then who was "I"?

This story reveals a profound operational logic of the "Identity Level": the fundamental purpose of all efforts on our lower floors is, in many cases, to maintain and prove this core identity on the fourth floor.

A person who takes "I am a good person" as their core identity will unconsciously suppress their true needs and anger (behavior), because in their belief system, "good people" are "not supposed to be selfish" and "not supposed to lose their temper." To maintain this "good person" identity, they would rather sacrifice themselves.

A person who takes "I am a victim" as their core identity will unconsciously seek evidence in life that proves they are "persecuted" or "misunderstood" (behavior), and will treat those who genuinely care about them with suspicion and aloofness. Because if they accept that they can be responsible for their own lives, their "victim" identity will face the danger of collapse.

At the organizational level, the power of this "identity" is what we call "brand recognition" or "organizational DNA."

Let's look back at Nokia. What was its core identity? It was the sturdy, reliable "leader" of the global telecommunications industry, the one that could "smash walnuts." This identity earned it the world during the feature phone era. But when the smartphone era arrived, and the world's rules of the game shifted from "whose phone is more durable" to "whose phone is more fun, more intelligent," Nokia's overly successful, overly heavy "anchor of identity" prevented it from turning around nimbly.

For Nokia to embrace the smartphone market—full of uncertainty, requiring rapid iteration, and even a bit of a "death by entertainment" spirit—it would mean smashing its most prized "reliable leader" plaque in its fourth-floor living room with its own hands. This was almost "self-destruction." Psychologically, it was too painful. So we saw that all its struggles were merely attempts to understand and reshape the new world with its old identity, ultimately being cruelly abandoned by the times.

Therefore, our exploration of the fourth floor is perhaps the most courageous of all levels. It requires us to confront the question we are most familiar with, and most afraid to touch.

We need to ask ourselves:

What is my most core identity tag, the one I use to define myself?
How has this identity protected me in the past? What has it brought me?
Today, is it empowering me, making me freer, or is it limiting me, making me more vulnerable?
If, just if, I were to temporarily shed this identity tag, how would I feel? Would I feel a sense of relief, or immense fear?
After shedding all these tags, who is the "me" that remains?

This exploration is not about immediately abandoning all identity affiliations. No, that's unrealistic and unnecessary. Its purpose is to move us from "unconscious identification" with an identity to an "conscious choice."

It is to make us understand that we "have" an identity, but we "are not" that identity. Just as we wear clothes, but these clothes are not our skin.

When we can achieve this, we begin to transform from a "statue" firmly fixed by identity tags into a true "dancer" who can gracefully move between different roles while maintaining an inner core.

#### **Chapter Six: The Top Floor: In the Clamor, Why Do We Still Need to Gaze at the Stars?**

Passing through the fourth-floor living room, filled with self-reflection on "who I am," we step onto the last, often narrowest and dustiest, staircase, arriving at the highest level of this inner architecture.

Here is the attic, the "Spirit and Mission Level."

When "spirit" or "mission" is mentioned, many of us instinctively feel a sense of distance, even a hint of resistance. These words sound too grand, too remote, as if they are the exclusive domain of saints, philosophers, or great entrepreneurs, having little to do with us ordinary people struggling with daily trivialities.

But I want to say, this might be one of the most profound misunderstandings of ourselves in our era.

The existence of the attic is not for us to "detach" from the lower floors, which are full of earthly life, to pursue some ethereal "realm." On the contrary, the attic exists to provide a final "coordinate of meaning" for all the chaos, struggles, efforts, and fatigue downstairs.

It is that skylight.

Every day, we deal with bills, emails, chores, and relationships downstairs; these are all necessary. But if we never take a moment to go up to the attic, open the skylight, and glimpse the vast, serene starry sky beyond our personal joys and sorrows, then all our efforts downstairs will inevitably become shriveled, fragile, and ultimately lose direction in the daily grind.

The lack of "meaning" is a widespread "psychological flu" in modern society. We have everything, yet feel we have nothing. We are omnipotent, yet don't know where to go. This is precisely because too many of us have blocked the staircase leading to the attic.

I hope that through this exploration, I can bring the word "mission" down from the altar of grand narratives and back into the daily lives of each of us.

The starry sky in the attic doesn't have to be a star of the magnitude of "changing the world" or "contributing to human progress." It can be anything that, when you do it, makes you temporarily forget time, forget yourself, and feel connected to something broader and more enduring.

It is the tranquility and creative joy a gardener feels in the early morning weekend, tending to their garden. In that moment, they are connected to the rhythm of nature, to the miracle of life. This connection is their starry sky.

It is the complete focus and immersion a history enthusiast feels, like a detective in a library's dusty archives, trying to piece together the truth of a historical period. In that moment, they are connected to humanity's past and future, to the transmission of knowledge. This connection is their starry sky.

It is the gentle yet powerful, selfless love a mother feels in the dead of night, tucking her sleeping child into bed. In that moment, she is connected to the continuation of life, to a responsibility beyond the individual. This connection is her starry sky.

It can even be a programmer's heartfelt, intellectual satisfaction after repeated debugging, finally writing a piece of exquisitely elegant, perfectly concise code. In that moment, they are connected to the beauty of logic, to the harmony of order. This connection is also their starry sky.

The starry sky of the attic is not a goal we need to "achieve," but a sense of connection we can "experience." It provides us with a spiritual "anchor point," allowing us a place to rest our souls when we are disoriented by the tumultuous waves of life downstairs.

At the organizational level, this "top-floor starry sky" is what we call "vision" and "mission."

A company that only talks about "profitability" (first-floor behavior) and "market share" (second-floor capability), even if it achieves temporary success, will struggle to possess true "organizational resilience" that can weather economic cycles. Because its employees are merely "mercenaries" trading time for money.

A truly great company, however, must have a clear and bright starry sky in its attic.

Take Patagonia, an outdoor brand I greatly admire, as an example. Its mission statement is: "We're in business to save our home planet."

Note that its mission is not "to be the best outdoor brand" or "to provide customers with the highest quality products." These are merely beliefs and identities of the third or fourth floor. Its attic is connected to something far grander than "business" itself—the future of the Earth.

This "top-floor declaration" is like a powerful light illuminating the entire building.

To fulfill this mission, its foundation (Environmental Level) must be built on responsibility towards nature, so it will invest in environmentally friendly materials regardless of cost; its first floor (Behavioral Level) will take actions that seem "incomprehensible" in traditional business logic, such as donating all sales on "Black Friday" and running "Don't Buy This Jacket" ads, urging people to reduce unnecessary consumption; its fourth floor (Identity Level) thus elevates from a mere "apparel company" to an "advocate and activist for environmentalism."

It is precisely because of this starry sky that it attracts not just ordinary "employees," but a group of "partners" who share a common belief. People work for it not just for a salary, but to participate in something meaningful. This is the power of the attic.

So, for our exploration of the top floor, the question is no longer about "who I am," but about "who/what do I serve?"

This question also does not require a grand answer.

It is merely a gentle invitation, inviting us, in a busy moment, to be willing to climb that perhaps narrow staircase, open that perhaps dusty skylight, and then, look up.

To see what, beyond our personal world, truly matters, truly moves us, truly makes us feel that living is something broader and more worthwhile than "solving problems" and "achieving goals."

Once you find that piece of starry sky that belongs to you, even if it's just a glimpse, the entire lighting system of your inner architecture will be transformed.

#### **Chapter Seven: Resonance: How Does One Building Affect Another?**

Thus far, we have, like patient explorers, walked through each of the six levels of our inner architecture. From the "Environmental Level" underground, which determined our initial parameters, to the "Mission Level" at the top, which provides our ultimate coordinates of meaning.

But if we merely understand this exploration as a "categorized" tour of six independent rooms, then we have missed the most profound and fascinating secret of this building.

This secret is: this building is "alive."

It is not a mechanical superposition of six isolated levels, but an organic, breathing, "resonant" living organism full of energy flows. Each level is like a tuning fork; when one is struck, the others, no matter how far apart, will hum along, either strongly or weakly.

Understanding this "resonance" is the key to understanding ourselves and our relationship with the world.

This resonance first follows a top-down, waterfall-like "radiation" effect.

When the attic skylight is opened and a beam of starlight (mission) shines in, it instantly changes the entire building's lighting system. This light will penetrate the fourth floor, giving a clear outline to a vague "identity"; it will illuminate the third floor, making those old, restrictive "belief" blueprints visible in the light; it will point the direction for the tools to be used in the second-floor "capability" workshop; finally, it will pour into the first-floor hall, making all the "behaviors" there confident, powerful, and directed.

An entrepreneur who takes "using technology to simplify a complex world" as their mission (top floor) will naturally adopt "I am a problem-solver, not a businessman" (fourth-floor identity) as their core identity. This identity will drive them to believe in the principle of "user value above all else" (third-floor belief), and to learn the cutting-edge technologies for it (second-floor capability), ultimately manifested in their tirelessly refining every detail of the product (first-floor behavior).

You see, a "first intention" from the top floor, like a drop of water falling into the calm center of a lake, creates ripples that spread, layer by layer, across the entire surface. This is an extremely powerful, inside-out creativity.

But resonance is not always so poetic. It can also, like a sinking foundation, "erode" a building from the bottom up.

Imagine a person who is long exposed to a suppressive and negative work environment (basement). Initially, they might just feel suppressed and unhappy. But day after day, this cold, damp "humidity" from the foundation begins to spread upward.

It will first erode the first floor. Their "behaviors" will start to become passive, perfunctory, losing initiative.

Then, the dampness will reach the second floor. They will begin to doubt their "capabilities," feeling "incapable of this and that," even if they were once a very confident person.

Next, the "belief" blueprints on the third floor will become blurred and moldy in the dampness. They might start to embrace a cynical belief like "that's just how work is, no need to take it too seriously" to make themselves feel better.

If this erosion is allowed to continue, it will eventually reach the fourth floor. Their once clear "identity" as a "talented professional" will be completely shaken, or even collapse, turning into "I'm just a mediocre, insignificant cog in the machine."

The "collapse" of an inner architecture is rarely due to the sudden disappearance of a top-floor mission, but often because we have long and numbly ignored the seemingly minor, continuous "negative resonance" from the basement and first floor.

And the most awe-inspiring aspect of this resonance is that it is never confined to the interior of a single building.

Our inner architectures are never isolated islands. They are connected to each other, forming a vast, invisible "city skyline." Each person's inner state is like a signal base station, continuously emitting "resonance waves" of a certain frequency outward, profoundly influencing the other buildings around us.

A leader whose heart is filled with anxiety and insecurity will transmit the "vibration" of their inner architecture through their contradictory decisions (behavior) and suspicious management style (belief), creating an atmosphere of distrust and self-preservation throughout the team (the basement environment for all team members). Ultimately, even if they have top talent (the second-floor capabilities of team members), they cannot achieve efficient collaboration (the first-floor behavior of the team). Their individual inner disorder leads to the collective dysfunction of the entire system.

Conversely, a community key figure with a stable, kind heart, the warm and firm "resonance waves" emanating from their building can miraculously "repair" damaged buildings that come near them.

I once heard a story about community psychological assistance. In a community undergoing post-disaster reconstruction, there was an elderly woman who was herself a victim, but her living room became a "shelter" open to everyone. She never preached grand theories, but simply quietly brewed hot tea for everyone and listened to each person's story. The calm and powerful belief of "everything will be alright" (her third floor) emanating from her inner architecture provided a safe, healing "environmental field" (the visitors' basement) for everyone who came there. In this environmental field, many broken, terrified souls were slowly able to piece themselves back together.

This is the power of resonance. It makes us understand that our relationship with the world is not a simple opposition of "me" versus "not me." Each of us is both a resident of our own building and a shaper of the environments of countless buildings around us. We are both "resonated with" by others and simultaneously "resonating" with others.

This understanding imbues us with a profound "sense of responsibility," and an equally profound "sense of power."

It gives us a clear inner reflection when we feel hurt by the external world—"Besides complaining about the dampness in the basement, can I light a brighter lamp on my upper floors?"

It also gives us a calm awareness when interacting with others—"What kind of 'resonance wave' am I currently emitting to the world around me? Is it anxiety, or calm? Is it judgment, or kindness?"

Our relationship with the world is quietly defined in this give and take, this ebb and flow of resonance.

### **Part Three: The Art of Renovation: Coexisting with Inner and Outer Chaos**

#### **Chapter Ten: From "Awareness" to "Choice" to "Creation"**

Having completed a deep exploration of our inner architecture and even the world we inhabit, a most important and urgent question naturally arises:

"So, what should I do?"

Having clearly seen the dampness in the basement, the clamor on the first floor, the traps on the second floor, the constraints on the third floor, the confusion on the fourth floor, and the distant starlight on the top floor... what then? How can we avoid being overwhelmed by this overly clear "diagnosis" and truly pick up our tools to begin a gentle yet firm "inner renovation" of our own?

The art of this "renovation" cannot be reduced to a mechanical process like a "seven-step success method." But it does follow an organic, spiraling inner rhythm. This rhythm consists of three inseparable movements: **Awareness**, **Choice**, and **Creation**.

**The First Movement: The First Step of Revolution—"Awareness"**

The true starting point of all change is not "action," but "awareness."

Within our inner architecture, too many automated, unconscious "background programs" are running. Fears from the basement, old regulations from the third-floor study—they are like invisible puppet masters, manipulating our first-floor behaviors from behind the scenes. And "awareness" is shining a light on this dark background.

Its core is not to "judge" or "find fault," but simply to "see."

To see how, when your partner merely offered a suggestion, the alarm of "I'm not good enough" was instantly triggered within you.
To see how, when you had an excellent idea in a meeting but ultimately chose to remain silent, the belief of "the nail that sticks out gets hammered down" quietly held your shoulder.
To see how, when you once again fell into "performative" busyness, the deep fear within you of "stopping."

The practice of "awareness" can be simple. It can be spending ten minutes at the end of the day, writing down the three moments that most stirred your emotions, and then, like a curious detective, asking yourself: "From which floor of my inner architecture did this emotion's echo come?"

This light, in itself, possesses powerful strength. Because when a thought, an emotion, a behavioral pattern is illuminated by the light of "awareness," it transforms from an unshakeable "fact" of "who you are" into an "object" that can be observed and examined by you.

You are no longer "your" anger, but you "have" an emotion of anger.
You are no longer a procrastinator, but you "have" a habit of procrastinating.

This small distance is where freedom begins.

**The Second Movement: "Choice" at the Crossroads**

Once "awareness" has created this precious distance for us, we transform from a "robot" automatically controlled by programs into a "human" standing at a crossroads.

We gain the right to "choose."

This choice is not about immediately staging a violent revolution to "smash the old world." No, that usually only provokes stronger resistance from the inner system. This choice is more like a gentle "negotiation," a "dialogue" full of empathy.

When you once again "become aware" that the belief "never trouble others" is preventing you from asking a colleague for help, you can try, in your mind, to have a conversation with this belief:

"I see you. I know you exist to protect me, to make me an independent person who isn't disliked. You really helped me a lot in my childhood. I am very grateful to you."

"However, I am an adult now. In a complex project, seeking collaboration is no longer 'troubling others,' but a sign of professionalism and wisdom. Your indiscriminate, excessive protection is now starting to hurt me."

"So, dear old friend, would you be willing to step back a little and let me try? Let me see if the sky will truly fall when I choose to 'trust' my colleagues and send them a signal for help?"

You see, this is not a battle, but a "renegotiation." We are not eliminating the old belief, but updating our "contract terms" with it. We begin to have the power to choose—to choose when to heed its advice, and when to politely but firmly say to it: "Thank you, but this time, I want to try something different."

**The Third Movement: The "Leverage Point" of Action—"Creation"**

A grand blueprint needs a tiny "lever" to be moved. And this lever is a specific, executable, even somewhat "insignificant" "new behavior."

This is the movement of "creation." It completely shatters the illusion of "achieving everything in one go" and dissolves our obsession with "perfection."

If you want to become a more confident person (adjusting the fourth-floor identity), you don't need to read a hundred books on confidence (hoarding capabilities on the second floor), but today, in your next speech, choose to raise your voice just a little bit higher than usual (a tiny creation of first-floor behavior).

If you want to reshape the belief that "stability trumps everything" (updating the third-floor belief), you don't need to immediately quit your job to travel the world, but this weekend, choose to take a completely unfamiliar route to the supermarket that you've never taken before (a tiny creation of first-floor behavior).

Why are these "micro-creations" so important?

Because it is precisely these new, tiny behaviors that bring brand new "experiential data" to our old inner architecture. When your voice is a little louder, and you find that the sky hasn't fallen, and colleagues are actually listening to you more attentively—this new "data" will, like a drop of water, permeate upward, quietly but continuously loosening that old "I am not worthy of being heard" identity on your fourth floor.

When you discover an interesting little shop on that unfamiliar road and feel a small surprise—this new "data" will, like a ray of sunshine, permeate upward, quietly but continuously challenging that old "unknown equals danger" rule on your third floor.

Change thus occurs quietly, in a spiraling cycle of "awareness," "choice," and "micro-creation."

It is not a grand project that requires you to hold your breath and grit your teeth.

It's more like, next to your old house, you're unhurriedly building a small "sunroom" filled with sunshine and possibilities, using a stone and a piece of wood you pick up each day.

You don't need to demolish the old house immediately. You will simply find yourself increasingly enjoying being in that new space you created with your own hands.

Until one day, when you look back, you will be surprised to find that the old house you once thought was indestructible has, at some point, transformed into a spacious and free backyard for you to plant flowers.

### **Epilogue: Stepping Off the Carousel**

Now, let us return to where the story began.

Back to that magnificent, noisy, never-ending carousel.

After completing this long and profound exploration of our inner architecture, we might look at the figures still striving on the carousel—those "efficiency addicts," "knowledge anxious," and "life cosplayers"—with a new perspective.

Our gaze might carry less unconscious judgment and more gentle understanding. Because we now know that their seemingly futile, spinning-in-place running is not due to foolishness or laziness. It is an involuntary dance, manipulated by the invisible forces of our inner architecture. The harder they run in the first-floor hall, perhaps, is only because their basement fears are deeper, or the starlight on their top floor is dimmer.

And what about us?

After undergoing a complete self-exploration from the basement to the attic, we might discover that our deepest desire is no longer, "How can I run faster than others on this horse?"

But rather, "Can I choose to step off?"

"Stepping off," this seemingly simple action, completed in one step, is here a deeply meaningful inner revolution.

"Stepping off" means we choose to disengage from that passive, unconscious, "autopilot" mode, swept along by collective anxiety.

"Stepping off" means we are willing to abandon the illusion that "if I just try a little harder, everything will be alright," and courageously admit that certain deep structures of our inner architecture indeed have problems.

"Stepping off" further means we decide to stop expending our precious life energy on repetitive "behavioral" patterns that bring no real change. We decide to reclaim that energy and invest it in a quieter, deeper, and more creative "inner renovation."

This is everything we have learned in this lengthy exploration report.

We have learned to use the light of "awareness" to illuminate the background programs that once controlled us in the dark.
We have learned to create a valuable crossroads of "choice" for ourselves in the pauses of automatic reactions.
We have learned to use tiny, concrete "creations" to bring new experiences and possibilities to our old building.

This exploration report ultimately gives us not a precise "map" marking the location of all treasures. Maps are static, while life is fluid.

It is more like a "compass." A dynamic compass in your hand that can always point you towards "possibility" when you are lost. It allows you, at any moment, at any level, to find that "present" leverage point to recalibrate and restart.

As you read this, do you feel a certain power quietly rising within your heart?

That is not something my words can grant you. That is merely the voice of your long-dormant, true "architect" within, awakened by your gaze of awareness.

Now, it's your turn.

This is not just the end of a report, but the beginning of an invitation.

An invitation to pick up this key called "awareness," to open the heavy door of your inner architecture. To listen to the echoes in the basement, to examine the regulations on the third floor, to gaze at the starry sky on the top floor.

An invitation to courageously make a choice, even a tiny one, that belongs to you, at your inner crossroads.

An invitation to begin today, to lay the first new brick, created by your own hands, for your inner world.

Imagine, as your inner architecture becomes increasingly stable, transparent, and harmonious because of your clarity and creativity, how the calm and firm "resonance wave" you emit will silently influence and nourish the world around you.

You will discover that what you build is not just your personal happiness and freedom.

It is also, in this noisy and weary era we collectively inhabit, a solid and warm "lighthouse" that can offer others a moment of shelter and the possibility of gazing at the stars.

Now, begin from where you are, from this breath.

Step off the carousel.

And then, begin your own unique and magnificent journey of construction.
