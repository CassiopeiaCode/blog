### **Introduction: The Night's Visitor**

At one in the morning, the city was plunged into deep silence, with only the occasional sound of cars in the distance, like a weary sigh.

My friend Guanchen, once again at this hour, stared blankly at the ceiling.

His body was like a wrung-out sponge, every cell screaming for "rest." His eyelids were as heavy as lead weights, a full day of high-intensity work having already drained all his energy. Yet, his brain, that disobedient, overactive, self-appointed command center, was hosting a grand party.

"There are still two details not finalized in tomorrow morning's meeting materials."
"The wording of the reply for the project to follow up on this afternoon needs to be re-considered."
"Oh, I forgot to renew the car insurance."
"I promised to take the kids to the science museum last week, can I make it happen this weekend?"
"Would that unintentional remark be misunderstood by colleagues?"

Thoughts, like runaway wild horses, galloped wildly across the plains of his skull, stirring up dust clouds. Each thought was a hook, pulling him back from the brink of sleep into the abyss of wakefulness. He tried all the popular methods: deep breathing, counting sheep until the flock protested, opening a meditation app and listening to soothing guided instructions, only to find himself silently analyzing whether the guide's pronunciation was standard.

"I just want to get some sleep," Guanchen said to me with a wry smile during a late-night chat. "Why does it feel like I'm fighting a battle I can never win? My body has clearly surrendered, but my brain is stubbornly holding its ground."

Guanchen's predicament, I believe, is not unfamiliar to you. Perhaps you are him, or perhaps there are countless "Guanchens" around you. We live in an era that values efficiency and control; we are accustomed to making lists for life, setting KPIs for work, and we believe that with the right methods, all problems can be "solved." Thus, when sleep, this most primitive and instinctive behavior, begins to "lose control," we fall into a deep sense of frustration and anxiety.

We treat insomnia as a bug, a system malfunction that needs to be fixed. We search online for "ten tips for falling asleep fast," we buy expensive melatonin and ergonomic pillows, we try to "fix" it with various tools, like a strict engineer dealing with a problematic machine.

But the harder we try, the tighter the door to dreamland seems to close.

This article doesn't want to give you another "sleep aid tips list." Because the root of the problem might not be that we lack techniques, but that we've taken the wrong stance and posture from the very beginning.

I want to invite you to temporarily lay down all "battle" weapons and look at this late-night visitor from a different perspective.

What if insomnia isn't an enemy to be vanquished?

What if it's not an accidental malfunction, but a long-planned visit? What if it's a messenger, weary from travel, bringing you a letter from the deepest part of your heart, a letter you've ignored for too long amidst the hustle and bustle of the day?

This messenger might appear a bit unkempt, even a little rough, but its intention is not to deprive you of rest, but to yearn to be heard by you. It's saying in this intense way: "Hey, stop and look at me. There are things you can no longer pretend not to see."

This letter might contain your suppressed anxieties, hidden unfulfilled desires, recorded fatigue alarms from your body, or perhaps, just a vibrant inspiration longing to be expressed.

What we need is not to drive away this messenger with more noise, but to quiet down, pour him a cup of tea, gather courage, open that letter, and read it word by word, understanding its meaning.

This is a long, late-night conversation with oneself.

In this book, we will learn together how to become a patient and gentle listener. We will no longer treat insomnia as an enemy, but learn its language and understand its intentions. We will explore how to build a peaceful sanctuary for the brain's "manager" when he works overtime late at night; how to provide a stage for the inner "artist" when he is passionate; and how to play a meaningless game with the weary "clown" when he is tired of everything.

Ultimately, you will find that true peace comes not from victory, but from reconciliation.

When you finally understand that letter and say to the messenger, "Thank you, I've heard you," he will smile and quietly depart.

And sleep, after this gentle reconciliation, is the sweetest gift that naturally descends.

So, are you ready? Let's turn off the glaring overhead light, switch on a warm bedside lamp, and begin this long conversation with ourselves, and with the night.

### **Chapter One: The Illusion of Control—Why the Harder You Try, the More Awake You Become**

Have you ever had this experience?

You lie in bed and tell yourself, "Okay, relax, don't think about anything, it's time to sleep."

This sentence is like a spell. The moment you utter it, your brain immediately becomes more alert than ever. It will immediately begin to "check" if you are truly relaxed. "Are my shoulders relaxed? They still feel a bit tense. Is my breathing deep enough? Is it too deliberate? My legs feel a bit numb. Oh, is that thought still there? Damn, it is."

The more you command yourself "don't think," the more thoughts surge in your mind, like an endless barrage of bullet comments. The more you yearn for "relaxation," the stiffer your body becomes, like a recruit giving a speech for the first time.

This is the first, and most core, paradox of sleep: **we can never achieve "relaxation" through "effort."**

This might sound convoluted, but it is precisely the quagmire most insomniacs find themselves in. Our era almost takes "effort" and "control" as golden rules. We firmly believe that as long as we put in enough effort and energy, we can control the direction of our careers, the increase or decrease of wealth, and even the trajectory of our lives. We are the masters of our lives, the CEOs of our destinies.

This belief is often effective in the daytime world. It drives us to learn, work, and create value. But when night falls, and we bring this "control everything" success logic into the bedroom, a war destined to fail begins.

Imagine you are in a wrestling match with someone. Your goal is to pin him down. You exert all your strength, mobilize every muscle, and use various techniques. But you quickly discover that this match is incredibly difficult. Because for every bit of strength you use, your opponent's strength seems to increase by the same amount. The harder you fight, the more stubbornly he resists. You roll back and forth on the mat, sweating profusely, exhausted, yet unable to determine a winner.

Until finally, you lie exhausted on the ground, only to suddenly realize an absurd truth—the opponent you've been wrestling with all night is yourself.

"Trying to sleep" is just such a wrestling match with yourself.

The "you who wants to sleep" is both the referee and one of the contestants. And the "uncontrolled," scattered-thought you is the other side. The harder the "you who wants to sleep" tries, the more anxiously it tries to suppress and control the "you who won't sleep," the more intense your inner conflict becomes, and the more your entire nervous system is in a highly "battle-ready" state.

How can sleep occur in this state? Sleep, physiologically speaking, is the result of the parasympathetic nervous system taking over, which is responsible for our body's "rest and digest" mode. "Fighting," whether real or imagined, is dominated by the sympathetic nervous system, which makes our heart beat faster, breathing quicken, muscles tense, ready to "fight or flee" at any moment.

You can't step on the gas pedal and expect the car to stop. Similarly, you can't keep your mind on a battlefield and expect your body to drift into dreamland.

Many friends, like Guanchen, have fallen into an even deeper trap—"relaxation anxiety." They learned various relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, body scans, and guided imagery. These are excellent tools, but driven by a "control" mindset, they became distorted.

They would mentally score their relaxation process. "Today's meditation focus was only 60 points, not good enough." "During the body scan, the sensation in my left foot wasn't clear enough, a failure." "The guided imagery wasn't even finished, and I started thinking about work again, I got distracted again."

Relaxation became a new KPI. Sleep became an exam that could only be passed by "correctly executing relaxation techniques." The pressure of this exam even exceeded that of daytime work. Consequently, they were not only anxious about "unfinished work" but also doubly anxious about "poor relaxation."

Doesn't this sound absurd? Yet this is the drama we enact upon ourselves every day.

Therefore, before we delve into any specific "methods," we must first undergo a fundamental "mindset demolition." We must shake, even destroy, the deeply ingrained belief within us—"I can, and should, control my sleep."

The truth is, you cannot.

Sleep, like love, inspiration, and happiness, is a naturally occurring state. It is an "invitation," not a "capture." It is more like a guest; you can only clean the room for him, light a warm lamp, prepare a comfortable bed, and then quietly await his arrival. You cannot rush to the door and rudely drag him in, nor can you throw a tantrum because he didn't arrive at your expected time.

The more anxiously you peek through the keyhole, the more likely this sensitive guest is to pass by without entering.

Therefore, all the "ways" that will be introduced later in this book, whether order, expression, or play, are not weapons for you to "fix" sleep. On the contrary, they are exercises to help you "lay down your arms." Their purpose is not to help you better "control" your brain, but to teach you to coexist peacefully with the "uncontrolled" part.

From this moment on, please try to repeat a sentence to yourself in your mind:

**"I don't have to conquer my wakefulness, I just need to accompany it."**

Let this sentence be the cornerstone of our journey ahead. Giving up the fight is the first step towards peace. When we stop wrestling with ourselves, we can then hear our true inner voice, and truly understand what that late-night visitor wants to tell us.

This is hard, I know. Because "giving up control," for us modern people accustomed to controlling everything, is itself a profound fear.

But please believe me, behind that fear lies the door to freedom and peace. And together, we are about to gently push it open.

### **Chapter Two: Basic Self-Check—Listening to the Body's Primitive Language**

Before we dive headfirst into the vast and complex forest of our inner selves, to explore profound questions about "meaning," "anxiety," and "existence," we must first do one thing.

Something extremely simple, yet often completely forgotten by us "overthinking" modern people.

That is, to look down and see the ground beneath our feet—our body.

We are too accustomed to treating the body as a silent vessel serving the brain. It works tirelessly, carrying our ambitions, fatigue, desires, and sorrows. We only glance at it impatiently when it hurts, gets sick, or goes on strike, thinking, "What's wrong with you again?"

However, the body possesses an older, more honest wisdom than we imagine. It doesn't engage in complex philosophical speculation like the brain, nor does it perform dramatic internal monologues like emotions. Its language is primitive, direct, and undeniable.

It constantly sends us signals through the simplest terms like "hot" and "cold," "tight" and "loose," "comfort" and "discomfort."

Many times, the "turbulent waves" that keep us tossing and turning late at night do not stem from some profound existential crisis or philosophical dilemma, but merely from the body's simplest cry for help. A "I'm too hot," a "I've been steeped in caffeine for too long," or a "My back is about to break."

Sadly, our brain, that "screenwriter" who loves complex plots, often ignores these simple, direct signals. It is more inclined to overinterpret this physical discomfort as a complicated psychological drama. Thus, a disturbance that could have been quelled by "throwing off the covers" or "doing some stretches" ultimately escalates into an all-night debate about "midlife crisis" or "the meaning of life."

This is not to deny the importance of psychological factors, but to emphasize a fundamental order: first, settle the honest "animal" that is the body, then listen to the complex "poet" within.

Therefore, before you begin any psychological exploration, please be sure to complete this "body hardware" self-check list. This might be the most immediate, unpretentious, and important thing you can do for your sleep.

**Body Hardware Self-Check List (The Animal Check-in)**

Please, like a diligent zookeeper, quickly check and address the following basic physical factors before preparing your "pet" (which is yourself) for sleep:

**1. Light: Is your cave dark enough?**

Our ancestors rose with the sun and rested with it. This rhythm is etched deep within our genes. Light, especially the ubiquitous blue-light-rich screen light of our era, is the strongest signal telling our bodies, "It's daytime, stay alert."

When you're still scrolling on your phone, staring at a flickering screen, or working under bright lights an hour before bed, you're essentially shouting at your body: "Hey! Don't sleep! Get up and party!" This will greatly inhibit the secretion of a hormone called "melatonin" in your body, which is the key messenger guiding us into a state of sleep.

**Action Directives:**
-   **Implement "Digital Sunset":** Set a bedtime alarm (e.g., 10:30 PM) and name it "Digital Sunset." As soon as the alarm rings, put down all electronic devices immediately, as if hearing the quitting time bell.
-   **Dim the Lights:** Replace the main light source in your bedroom with a soft, warm-toned bedside lamp. Let the environment enter "dusk mode" in advance.
-   **Physical Isolation:** If external light pollution cannot be avoided, invest in a good quality blackout curtain or a comfortable eye mask. Simple and crude, but extremely effective.

**2. Temperature: Are you in "slightly cool" rather than "warm" conditions?**

This is a common misconception. We often think a warm bed is standard for sleep, but physiology tells us that the body's core temperature naturally drops when falling asleep. A relatively cool sleeping environment, can more effectively help the body initiate this "cooling down" process, thus entering sleep more quickly.

If you often wake up hot in the middle of the night, or feel suffocated by the stuffiness under the covers, it's very likely that the temperature of your "cave" is too high.

**Action Directives:**
-   **Adjust Room Temperature:** Set your air conditioner to a comfortable range that makes you feel "slightly cool" rather than "warm" (typically between 18-22 degrees Celsius, varying by individual).
-   **Choose Appropriate Bedding:** Use more breathable duvets and sleepwear, especially for those who tend to sweat.
-   **Warm Bath Before Bed:** Taking a warm bath 1-2 hours before bed will dilate your blood vessels, and after leaving the bathroom, your body's core temperature will naturally drop due to heat dissipation, which will induce strong drowsiness.

**3. Intake: Are there "uninvited guests" in your body?**

That latte you drank at three in the afternoon, those two extra glasses of red wine you had with dinner, or that piece of chocolate cake you snacked on before bed—these are all "uninvited guests" that sneak into your body late at night.

-   **Caffeine:** As a central nervous system stimulant, its half-life (the time it takes for the body to metabolize half of it) is as long as 4-6 hours. This means that the coffee you drank in the afternoon could very well continue to have an effect late into the night, like an invisible hand supporting your excited nerves from behind.
-   **Alcohol:** While alcohol can indeed make one feel drowsy quickly, it severely disrupts sleep architecture in the latter half of the night, leading to frequent awakenings and feeling more tired upon waking. It creates "stupor," not true "rest."
-   **Sugar:** Consuming a large amount of sugar before bed can cause your blood sugar to sharply rise and then rapidly fall like a roller coaster. This process might stimulate the secretion of adrenaline, causing you to suddenly wake up in the middle of the night.

**Action Directives:**
-   **Set "No-Intake" Times:** Try to avoid caffeine after midday (e.g., 2 PM). Within three hours before bed, avoid alcohol and heavy meals, especially high-sugar desserts.
-   **Establish a "Bedtime Drink" Habit:** If you need something to drink before bed, choose a cup of warm milk, a caffeine-free herbal tea (like chamomile), or simply a glass of warm water.

**4. Body: Is any part of your body "silently screaming"?**

For us modern people who sit for long periods, it's almost the norm for some part of the body to be in a state of chronic tension or discomfort. It could be tight shoulders and neck, an aching lower back, or restless legs.

During the day, we might be able to ignore these discomforts through sheer willpower. But at night, when all is quiet, these "screams" from the body are amplified infinitely, becoming an undeniable noise that constantly disturbs us.

**Action Directives:**
-   **Perform Gentle Bedtime Stretches:** No strenuous exercise is needed; just target the areas where you feel most tense with 5-10 minutes of gentle static stretching. For example, gently rotate your neck, stretch your back, or extend your hamstrings.
-   **Pay Attention to Your Sleeping Posture:** Find a sleeping position that allows all your muscles to completely relax. Sometimes, placing a small pillow under your knees or lower back can significantly relieve body pressure.
-   **Invest in a Good Mattress and Pillow:** These are companions we intimately interact with for one-third of our lives; ensure they provide adequate and correct support for your body.

Completing this checklist might only take you about ten minutes. But its significance goes far beyond that.

It's a declaration, a shift in posture. It means you begin to acknowledge that the body is not merely an appendage of the brain; it has its own language and needs. It means you begin to learn to be a considerate caregiver before becoming a profound thinker.

Only after you have provided your body with a dark, cool, "troublemaker-free," and sufficiently comfortable environment, can you say you have laid the most fundamental groundwork for the arrival of sleep.

At this point, if your brain still cannot calm down, then, good.

This indicates that the late-night visitor has indeed brought a letter about the "mind."

Now, we can finally, with peace of mind, open it.

### **Chapter Three: The Crossroads of Thought—Identifying Your "Insomnia Mode"**

Alright, now we have provided the body, this honest animal, with everything it needs: a cool, dark, comfortable cave, and ensured that no uninvited guests (like caffeine) are messing with its system.

But you find that the brain's party shows no signs of ending.

This is the most exciting part of the journey. Because it's almost certain that what's keeping you awake now is no longer mere physical discomfort, but a deeper, more complex psychological energy. The late-night messenger has finally, slowly, unfolded the letter from your inner self before you.

However, this letter is written in a special ink; it has no uniform format, and its content is not always straightforward. The content of the letter can be completely different for different people, and even for the same person on different nights.

After many late-night conversations with friends like Guanchen, I've found that although the details of the letter vary widely, its core "dramatic types" can often be categorized into three. When our minds cannot stop churning late at night, they are usually staging one of the following three dramas.

Identifying which play you are staging tonight is key to choosing the correct response. It's like standing at a crossroads, you need to read the signs to head in the right direction.

Now, let's become the audience of our inner theater together and see who the main character is tonight.

**Mode One: The "Manager" with Overloaded Tasks**

**Inner Monologue:** *"No, I have to think about it again... The third page of tomorrow's report, the data citation seems problematic. Oh, and the email to send to the client this afternoon, I need to adjust the tone. Also, next week's team meeting, the agenda needs to be prepared in advance. Oh, the kids' hobby class needs to be renewed, and the gas bill needs to be paid, I have to write it down. I can't sleep because I have too many things not 'handled'."*

**Dramatic Characteristics:**
In "Manager" mode, your brain is like a 24/7 project management center that never shuts down. The core of your thoughts is **"tasks"** and **"responsibilities."** It constantly reviews the past ("Where did I fall short today?") and plans the future ("What do I need to do tomorrow?").

Every thought here is like a to-do item, a checklist entry that needs to be crossed off. Your brain is immersed in a "problem-solving" inertia, believing that if it just goes over all these pending matters in its head, or even finds perfect solutions, it can then sleep peacefully.

Thinking in this mode is **linear, logical, and goal-oriented**. It is filled with "shoulds," "musts," and "what ifs." You feel like a company CEO, bearing the operational pressure of the entire company alone in the dead of night. You dare not sleep, because you fear that if you fall asleep, some important detail will be forgotten, or some potential risk will spiral out of control.

**Core Feelings:** **Anxiety, tension, an lingering desire for control and a sense of responsibility.** You feel tightly enveloped by an invisible "to-do list" net, unable to move.

**Mode Two: The "Artist" with Unfinished Passion**

**Inner Monologue:** *"Oh my god, I just had a brilliant idea! If I make that project this way, the effect will be explosive! I have to write it down. This feeling is amazing, I can feel my blood boiling. Or, that conversation with my friend this afternoon, it touched me so deeply, that complex emotion, that subtle connection between people, if I could just write it down... I can't sleep because there's a fire in my heart, it's burning, it longs to be expressed."*

**Dramatic Characteristics:**
In "Artist" mode, your brain transforms into a creative studio full of inspiration. The core of your thoughts is no longer cold "tasks," but a scorching **"energy"** or **"emotion."** This energy might stem from a brilliant idea, a profound conversation, a moving film, or even an experience of sadness or anger.

Every thought here is like a raw jade waiting to be sculpted, a poem on the verge of being born. Your thinking is **divergent, associative, full of colors and images**. It doesn't care about "getting things done," it only cares about "creating" and "expressing."

In this mode, you don't suffer from insomnia due to "anxiety"; on the contrary, you might feel an unusually excited, acute, or even euphoric state. You don't "want" to sleep, because sleeping feels like a waste, interrupting this precious creative impulse or profound emotional experience. You feel like a painter or poet struck by inspiration, dancing with your muse in the dead of night.

**Core Feelings:** **Excitement, exhilaration, creative urge, a strong impulse to express, or a profound emotion (whether joy or sorrow) that needs to be sorted and placed.**

**Mode Three: The Exhausted "Clown"**

**Inner Monologue:** *"Sleep, sleep, sleep... Why 'must' I sleep? Why? I just don't want to. It's so annoying. After working hard all day, don't I even have the freedom not to sleep at night? What should I think about? I don't know. What should I do? It's pointless. Everything is so boring, so irritating. I'm not thinking about specific things, I'm just annoyed by 'sleeping' itself. I hate this bed."*

**Dramatic Characteristics:**
In "Clown" mode, your brain stages an absurd play. The core of your thoughts is neither "tasks" nor "inspiration," but a **pure "boredom" and "rebellion."**

The thinking here is **chaotic, disorderly, and irrational**. It has no specific content; it attacks the act of "sleeping" itself. You are not troubled by a specific issue, but driven mad by the thought, "I must sleep."

This mode often appears after we are extremely tired, or have been suppressed by daytime rules and responsibilities for too long. It is a psychological "revenge bedtime procrastination." The repressed "mischievous child" or "clown" within, who yearns for freedom all day, jumps out in the dead of night. It uses the simplest and most direct way of "not sleeping" to defy all the "musts" and "shoulds" of the day. It is asserting its sovereignty in an irrational, even somewhat childish way: "Here, I'm in charge."

**Core Feelings:** **Irritation, rebelliousness, boredom, a baseless urge to destroy, and a deep aversion to all "effort" and "seriousness."**

---

So, dear friend, which play's audience are you sitting in tonight?

Please don't rush to judge. There is no good or bad among these three modes. They are merely different facets of our inner world, presented under specific pressures.

The "manager's" anxiety stems from his deep sense of responsibility.
The "artist's" exhilaration stems from his abundant vitality.
The "clown's" rebellion stems from his purest desire for freedom.

Do you see it clearly? Do you see who the main character accompanying you in the dead of night is?

When you can clearly identify it and softly speak its name, you have already completed the most important step. Because you are no longer a helpless person entangled by unknown monsters in the dark; you have become a clear-eyed observer, holding a map and seeing the monster's true form.

And next, we will learn three distinct "communication" methods for these three different types of "monsters."

---

### **Chapter Four: The Way of Order—Building a Sacred Sanctuary for the Mind**

If your diagnosis is "Manager" mode, then congratulations, you are a responsible, rigorous, and excellence-driven person. But at this moment, it is precisely this valuable quality that has you trapped in a quagmire. Your brain, this dedicated manager, refuses to clock out. It has turned the bedroom into a late-night office, and the bed into another conference table.

We cannot, and should not, "eliminate" this manager. His existence is the cornerstone of your career success and orderly life. What we need to do is not to fire him, but to gently and firmly tell him: "Dear manager, thank you for your hard work today. Now, it's time to rest. The office door should be closed."

"The Way of Order" is a set of ritualistic "off-duty procedures" that help you hand over tasks with your inner "manager." Its core is not to suppress thoughts, but to define clear boundaries for them, building a sacred sanctuary that the daytime hustle and bustle cannot penetrate.

**Bedtime Handover Ritual**

Please consider the following steps a solemn and peaceful ritual you grant yourself at the end of each day.

**Step One: Worry Deposit—Finding a "Home" for Your Thoughts**

Imagine you're an office worker about to leave for the day. You wouldn't carry all important documents and to-do notes home in your arms, would you? You'd neatly stack them on your desk or lock them in a filing cabinet.

We need to do the same for the scattered "tasks" in our minds.

**Action Directives:**
1.  **Prepare a "Worry Deposit Box" or "Handover Notebook":** Find a nice box, or a dedicated notebook, and place it by your bedside. This will be the "nighttime filing cabinet" for your thoughts.
2.  **"Unload" One by One:** 15 minutes before getting into bed, sit down and write down, one by one, all the things in your mind that are "not yet done," "need to worry about," or "must remember." Don't analyze them in your head; simply "unload" them from your brain onto paper.
    -   "Tomorrow 10 AM meeting materials, check data on page three."
    -   "Reply to Mr. Lin's email, mind the tone."
    -   "Remember to pay utility bills."
    -   "Take kids to the park next weekend."
3.  **Seal and Entrust:** After writing, take a deep breath. If you used slips of paper, put them all into the "Worry Deposit Box" and gently close the lid. If you used a notebook, solemnly close it.
4.  **Make a "Handover Statement":** In your mind or softly to yourself, say: "Alright, everything for today has been properly recorded here. Nothing will be forgotten. My work is now done, and it's safe here. I will deal with them tomorrow. Good night, work."

This seemingly simple action carries immense psychological suggestive power. Through a physical act, it sends a clear signal to your anxious "inner manager": your worries have been seen, recorded, and put away. You no longer need to "ruminate" over them repeatedly in your mind, because they now have a safe "home."

**Step Two: System Downclock—Body Prioritizes Thought**

With the work handover complete, next, we need to gradually lower the operating frequency of that "body machine" that has been running at high speed all day. We don't directly confront thoughts; instead, we go to the root, letting the body's "hardware" calm down first. As the body's tide recedes, the waves of thought will naturally subside.

**Action Directive: Diaphragmatic Breathing for Calibration**

This is the oldest and most powerful physiological relaxation tool. By changing your breathing pattern, it directly signals your nervous system to "switch to rest mode."

1.  **Posture:** Lie comfortably in bed, close your eyes. Place one hand gently on your abdomen.
2.  **Inhale:** Slowly and deeply inhale through your nose, feeling your abdomen expand like a balloon, gently pushing up your hand. Silently count to 4: 1…2…3…4…
3.  **Exhale:** More slowly and evenly exhale through your mouth or nose, feeling your abdomen gently fall back and contract. Silently count to 6: 1…2…3…4…5…6…
4.  **Cycle:** Repeat this process 8-12 times. Focus all your attention on the rise and fall of your abdomen and the counting in your mind.

**Key Point:** If your brain starts "meeting" again during the process, don't criticize yourself. Just gently, like leading a lost child, bring your attention back to your breath and abdomen, again and again. It doesn't need to be perfect, just a gentle return, over and over.

**Action Directive: The "3-2-1" Sensory Grounding Method**

Diaphragmatic breathing starts to slow down your system, while the "sensory grounding method" is a crucial step to thoroughly "land" you in the safe space of the present moment. It interrupts abstract thoughts about the past and future by forcefully anchoring your attention to concrete, neutral physical sensations.

1.  **Prepare for Landing:** Continue lying comfortably, maintaining steady breathing.
2.  **First Round of Landing:**
    -   **See:** In your mind's eye, clearly "see" 3 things in the room that you can perceive at this moment. No need to open your eyes, just "name" them mentally. (For example: "I see the outline of the bedside lamp... I see the folds of the curtain... I see the wardrobe handle...")
    -   **Hear:** Carefully and non-judgmentally listen to 3 sounds you can hear. (For example: "I hear the hum of the air conditioner... I hear the wind outside the window... I hear the sound of myself swallowing...")
    -   **Feel:** Shift your attention to 3 parts of your body and notice the sensations there. (For example: "I feel the contact between my back and the mattress... I feel my soles are a bit warm... I feel the weight of my fingers resting on the blanket...")
3.  **Second Round of Landing:** Repeat the above process, but focus on only 2 things for each sense.
4.  **Final Landing:** Repeat again, focusing on only 1 thing for each sense.

Most people feel an unprecedented sense of calm and "groundedness" after completing this exercise. Your "manager" who was soaring high and deep, has finally been brought back to the "earth's surface" of the present moment through this method. His voice might still be there, but it has become distant and blurry.

**Step Three: Gentle Negotiation—Final Permission**

Having completed all the above rituals, your mind and body have essentially entered "standby mode." Just before sleep, our guest, is about to knock, we can make one last gentle confirmation.

**Action Directive:**
Place your hand gently on your heart, and in your mind, say to the "manager" who might still be making a final resistance in some corner:

"I know you're still worried about that thing that wasn't perfectly handled. Thank you for your dedication and reminder. But now, I really need to rest. I ask you, please allow us, together, to rest quietly. Only when we are well-rested can we form a stronger team tomorrow to face new challenges. Can we?"

Remember, this is not a command, it is a **request**, a **negotiation**.

When you engage in this dialogue with this inner part of yourself with complete sincerity, you will often feel a wonderful "loosening" or an inner "agreement."

That is your "manager," finally letting go of his last stand, agreeing to clock out.

At this moment, the sanctuary door has gently closed.

You don't need to do anything else.

Just quietly lie in the peace you've created for yourself, waiting for the guest to arrive.

### **Chapter Five: The Way of Expression—Giving Form to Intangible Emotions and Inspiration**

Now, let's talk about a completely different kind of insomnia.

In this type of insomnia, you don't feel the task-overload anxiety of the "manager," but rather a peculiar, even somewhat pleasant, exhilaration. Your brain doesn't have a to-do list; instead, it's a surging ocean, filled with colorful ideas, powerful emotions, or stories ready to burst forth.

You are in "Artist" mode.

At this time, you are not troubled by "problems," but filled with "energy." This energy might be a resonance sparked by a hearty deep conversation with a friend during the day; it might be a brilliant project proposal you just conceived; or it could be a sudden, profound sadness about past events. Regardless of its external form, whether joy or sorrow, its internal essence is the same—it is a life force yearning to be "seen," "heard," and "expressed."

If the "manager's" insomnia is like endless overtime in the office, then the "artist's" insomnia is more like a late-night revelry in a creative studio, unwilling to leave.

You can't sleep, not because you "can't," but because you "don't want to." Sleeping feels like a letdown, a rude interruption of this precious energy.

For this passionate "artist," methods from "The Way of Order"—such as locking thoughts in a box, or forced sensory grounding—are often ineffective, even counterproductive. This is like trying to lock a burning flame in a filing cabinet; the flame will only burn brighter, perhaps even setting the cabinet ablaze.

We cannot suppress this energy, as that would only lead to deeper anxiety. The only thing we can do is provide it with a stage, allowing it to flow and dance freely until it is satisfied and naturally subsides.

"The Way of Expression" is a set of "midwifery" procedures that help you build a temporary stage for your inner "artist" and guide them to complete their creation.

**The Creator's Nocturne**

This process is not about "good or bad," "right or wrong," or "the quality of the work." Its sole purpose is to give that intangible energy a tangible outlet.

**Step One: Creating the Stage—Transforming from "Bed" to "Studio"**

When the "artist" takes the stage, the bed is no longer just a place for sleeping. It becomes your creative space. We need a simple ritual, to acknowledge this spatial transformation.

**Action Directives:**
1.  **Prepare your "Creative Tools":** Keep a favorite notebook and a comfortable pen by your bedside. A friend I know even keeps a simple set of colored pencils. These are your brushes and instruments for tonight.
2.  **Adjust Lighting and Posture:** Turn on your bedside lamp, imagining it as a spotlight on a stage. You can lean against the headboard, propping yourself up with pillows into a comfortable creative posture. This small action tells yourself: "Alright, now it's not 'sleep time,' but 'creation time.'"
3.  **Let Go of the Goal to "Fall Asleep":** This is the most crucial step. Please declare to yourself mentally: "I'm not planning to sleep tonight. I've decided to spend the next while accompanying this friend in my heart." When you completely abandon the goal of "having to fall asleep," paradoxically, the pressure associated with it dissipates. The "artist" hates being rushed, and now, you've given them an open-ended invitation to create.

**Step Two: Giving Form—Sculpting Intangible Energy**

Now, the stage is set. Next, it's time to invite the protagonist to appear. Remember, you are not there to "analyze" him, but to "depict" him.

**Action Directive: Free Writing (When the Energy is "Ideas" or "Stories")**

1.  **Start with an Opening:** If you have a story or a complex idea in your mind, write down the first sentence in your notebook. Any sentence will do. For example: "That afternoon, the sun was bright..." or "What I really want to say about that project is..."
2.  **Allow it to Flow:** Next, don't think about grammar, structure, or logic. Just allow your pen to move continuously across the paper. Pour out all your thoughts—related or unrelated, chaotic, jumping, childish—onto the page. You are not writing a timeless masterpiece; you are simply carving a channel for the rushing river in your mind to flow into the sea.
3.  **Write Until "Empty":** Continue writing until you feel that strong urge to express begin to wane, until you feel the noisy voice in your brain begin to quiet, until you feel a sense of "emptiness" and satisfaction.

**Action Directive: Emotional Sketch (When the Energy is "Emotion")**

Sometimes, that energy isn't a clear idea, but a vague yet strong emotion, such as sadness, anger, joy, or confusion. For this ineffable energy, words can sometimes feel inadequate.

1.  **Interview Your Emotion:** Pick up your pen, like a curious journalist, and start interviewing it.
    -   "Hello, my friend in my heart, what is your name?"
    -   "If you were a color, what color would you be?"
    -   "If you had a shape, what shape would it be? Sharp or rounded?"
    -   "What do you most want to do right now? Do you want to scream, or do you want to cry?"
2.  **"Draw" It Out:** Based on your "interview," draw it in your notebook. Use lines, color blocks, symbols to depict its appearance. A tangle of black lines might represent your anger; a constantly dripping blue teardrop might represent your sadness. You don't need any drawing skills; all you need is honesty.
3.  **Dialogue with It:** Next to your "emotional sketch," write down what you want to say to it. For example, say to the tangle of black lines: "I see you, anger. I know why you're here." Or, to the blue teardrop: "It's okay, sadness. You can flow safely here."

This process is a profound act of self-care. It means you no longer try to suppress or deny your emotions with "reason," but instead give them a space to be seen, acknowledged, and respected.

**Step Three: Satisfied Curtain Call—Returning from "Studio" to "Bed"**

When you feel that the inner energy, whether inspiration or emotion, has been fully expressed, transforming from a surging torrent into a calm stream, then creation time can end.

**Action Directives:**
1.  **Close the Notebook, Turn Off the "Spotlight":** Gently close your notebook and place it by your bedside. Turn off your bedside lamp.
2.  **Thank Your "Artist":** In your mind, say to the inner companion who just danced with you: "Thank you for sharing tonight, it was a wonderful collaboration. Now, we can rest together."
3.  **Feel the Peace:** Now, lie back down. Take a moment to feel your current state of mind and body. You will likely feel a sense of post-creative satisfaction and fatigue. The energy that made you excited has transformed into words and pictures on paper. It no longer needs to rush wildly through your body.

You have given tangible form to that intangible life force.

This is the highest respect for it.

And what it gives back to you is a peaceful sleep, born of contentment.

### **Chapter Six: The Way of Play—Letting Go of Serious Radical Behavior**

We finally arrive at the most peculiar, elusive, and also most entertaining play in the inner theater—the "Clown's" monologue.

If your insomnia is neither filled with the anxiety of specific tasks like the "manager," nor driven by a strong creative urge or emotion like the "artist," but manifests as a pure, unprovoked irritation and resistance towards "sleeping" itself. Then, welcome to the "Clown's" midnight playground.

At this time, you are like a child who has been suppressed by homework and rules all day; in the dead of night, the mischievous child within, yearning for freedom, finally breaks free. He doesn't want to solve any problems, nor does he want to create anything. He just wants to do one thing—cause mischief.

And "not sleeping" is the most direct and safest way he can think of to "cause mischief."

The more you command him, "Go to sleep!" the more fiercely the fire of rebellion burns within him. He'll jump around in your mind like a naughty child, making a mess of everything, but you just can't catch him. His very existence is a mockery of all "serious," "correct," and "meaningful" behaviors.

For this "inner clown," you cannot reason with him (that's the "manager's" language), nor can you give him a stage to express himself (that's the "artist's" language). The more seriously you treat him, the more you play into his hands, because you precisely become the "serious adult" he seeks to rebel against.

So, what should be done?

There's only one answer: **If you can't beat him, join him.**

If he wants to play, then play a sillier, more meaningless game with him. Use one absurdity to dissolve another.

"The Way of Play" is a radical behavior guide that helps you let go of all "shoulds" and "musts" and fool around with your inner "clown." Its core is to completely abandon "meaningfulness" and embrace "pointlessness."

**The Utterly Pointless Games**

When you find that the inner "clown" has taken over, and you are utterly tired of all attempts to "try to sleep," decisively give up resistance. Then, get out of bed and choose one game from the following list that you find the silliest and most likely to make you laugh, and then seriously execute it.

**Game One: Pillow Fort Construction**

-   **Game Rules:** Leave your bed—that battlefield symbolizing "pressure" and "failure" at this moment. Go to the living room and build a secret base for yourself using sofa cushions, chairs, blankets, and pillows. The sole function of this fort is to be "worry-free."
-   **How to Play:** Seriously build your fort, ensuring it's hidden enough and secure enough. Then, crawl inside like a child; you can bring a book, or just stay there. This act itself is a powerful declaration: "I have temporarily escaped from the adult world."
-   **Game Effect:** When you are immersed in this childish building game, the tense, serious thought of "I must sleep" will seem out of place, even a little ridiculous. You create a physical and psychological "safe zone" for yourself with a playful ritual.

**Game Two: Staring Contest with the Moon**

-   **Game Rules:** Go to the window, if there's a moon tonight. If not, a street light or distant building lights will do. Your task is to have a serious staring contest with that light source, to see who blinks first.
-   **How to Play:** Focus all your attention on gazing at that point of light. You can even talk to it in your mind, challenge it. This process is extremely boring, and also extremely focused.
-   **Game Effect:** This game is absurd enough to instantly break the tragic script in your mind of "I am a poor insomniac." At the same time, it's an excellent "single-point focus" exercise; when you dedicate all your mental energy to this silly contest, other distractions naturally find no place to reside.

**Game Three: Sock Sorting Ritual**

-   **Game Rules:** Open your wardrobe, take out all your socks, and pile them on the floor. Your task is to perform an unprecedented, extremely detailed sorting of them.
-   **How to Play:** You can sort them by color, by length, by material, or even pair socks you feel have "chemistry." Make this process as slow, focused, and ritualistic as possible.
-   **Game Effect:** This is a form of "dynamic meditation." Through a simple, repetitive action with a slight organizing function, you can effectively help your restless mind find an anchor. When your hands are busy, your brain finds it difficult to engage in high-intensity "overthinking."

**Game Four: Reverse Action Challenge**

-   **Game Rules:** Try doing some daily tasks with your non-dominant hand, such as brushing your teeth. Or, try walking backward from your bedroom to the kitchen to get a glass of water.
-   **How to Play:** The key is to experience that clumsy, uncoordinated feeling. You'll find that you need to invest immense attention to complete these actions that you normally do without thinking.
-   **Game Effect:** This is a powerful "pattern interruption" technique. By introducing a novel physical challenge that requires high concentration, it completely disrupts your habitual thought patterns. Your brain will switch from "irritation" mode to "solving new problems" mode, thus forgetting the previous obsession of "I can't sleep."

Which game you choose is not important. What is important is the spirit behind the game:

**Replace "useful" with "fun," and dissolve "seriousness" with "absurdity."**

When you start playing these silly games, your inner "clown" will feel very confused. He was originally the protagonist, controlling everything by "not sleeping." But now, you, the "serious adult," have started playing games even sillier than his. He finds that he is no longer the center of attention; the stage is occupied by more interesting things.

And then?

Maybe as you play, you'll genuinely laugh. And with a laugh, that tight string will break.
Maybe as you play, you'll get tired, lean back on the sofa, and fall asleep without realizing it.
Or perhaps, you'll play all night, be very tired the next day, but at least you'll have gained a secret night full of peculiar fun that no one else knows about, instead of a night of tossing and turning in bed, full of frustration from insomnia.

The Way of Play is a perilous path because it demands that you completely abandon the attempt to "become a better, more disciplined person."

But for the "clown" who is suffocated by seriousness, this "permission," this "indulgence," this "meaninglessness," is precisely the only cure.

### **Conclusion: Becoming Your Own Gentle Night Watchman**

Our late-night conversation, at this point, is drawing to a close.

We began with my friend Guanchen's anxious night staring at the ceiling, and along the way, we deconstructed the illusion of control that is "trying to sleep." We learned to first listen to the body's most primitive language, and then we entered our inner theater to identify the protagonists who took turns appearing in the dead of night—the worried "manager," the passionate "artist," and the "clown" tired of everything.

We found order for the "manager," a stage for the "artist," and played a silly game with the "clown."

Now, it's time to return to the most fundamental question: What was the purpose of all we've done?

Was it to master a foolproof set of "sleep techniques" and thereby "solve" the problem of insomnia once and for all?

No.

If so, then we would merely have jumped from one "trap of control" into another, more refined "trap of control."

The true purpose of our journey was not to add more sophisticated weapons to our arsenal to better defeat that "night's visitor."

But to ultimately understand that we don't need any weapons at all.

That visitor is not an enemy; he is us.

The Way of Order, the Way of Expression, the Way of Play—these three seemingly divergent paths are not external methodologies that you need to "choose." They are, by nature, three inherent forces, three ancient archetypes within your inner world.

The "inner healer" who yearns for order and control, the "inner muse" who longs for expression and creation, the "inner playful child" who desires freedom and fun—they have always resided within your heart.

Insomnia, this late-night messenger, comes knocking not to disturb you, but to remind you: Tonight, which inner companion do you most need by your side?

Your anxiety is calling for the "healer" to establish boundaries for you and bring peace.
Your inspiration is calling for the "muse" to channel your energy and bring creativity.
Your irritation is calling for the "playful child" to break seriousness for you and bring freedom.

Therefore, true wisdom lies not in how many specific steps and techniques you remember, but in whether you have cultivated a keener, gentler self-awareness.

Can you, on every restless night, instead of immediately falling into the panic of "What should I do?", first quiet down and gently ask yourself:

"My dear, what do you yearn for most right now?"

The gentle act of simply asking this question is, in itself, a profound healing. It means you no longer treat yourself as a "problem" that needs fixing, but as a living, breathing person who needs to be heard and satisfied.

Ultimately, you will find that you no longer need this "sleep guide." Because you have learned to become your own best "sleep consultant."

You have learned how to become, in the dead of night, your own most gentle night watchman—one who does not judge, does not rush, but simply quietly accompanies you.

Good night.
