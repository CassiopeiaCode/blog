### Introduction: Oh no, I seem to be stuck again!

Have you ever had moments like these?

It's late, and you swear to the screen, "This is the last short video." But half an hour later, you find yourself still tirelessly scrolling, with a hint of regret and an even stronger urge for "just one more." It feels as if your rationality is screaming from the shore, "Come back!" while your body, sitting in a small boat, happily drifts towards the endless sea of "just five more minutes."

Or, faced with an important task, you know exactly what to do, yet you're as if under a spell, preferring to mop the floor, wipe windows, groom the cat, or even enthusiastically study the rice cooker manual, anything but touch that task. We euphemistically call this "finding our state," but deep down, we know it's "strategic evasion." Only on the night before the deadline do we force ourselves into heroic action with a hundred cups of coffee and a sky full of regret.

Or perhaps, you meticulously planned a perfect personal improvement program, like "get abs in three months" or "read 50 books in half a year," even downloading the check-in app. The result? That gym membership card became the newest, yet most dormant, card in your wallet; most of those books were only opened to their prefaces, becoming the most stable lids for your instant noodles.

At these times, we're like a machine that suddenly jams, or a game character who can't find a save point. There's a voice in our hearts screaming, "Get moving! You can do it!" But our bodies and minds are entangled in an invisible, sticky spiderweb. This spiderweb smells of guilt, feels of anxiety; it traps us, and the more we struggle, the tighter it binds. We blame ourselves, we can't understand: "What's wrong with me? Why can't I just do it?"

Let me tell you, it might not really be because we're lazy or have weak willpower. More likely, it's just because we're lost, and what's more, we're lost inside our own house.

Imagine that our inner world is actually a wondrous and mysterious six-story building. This building isn't made of steel and concrete; it's constructed from our thoughts, emotions, memories, and dreams. It's unique, belonging only to us. Each floor offers a different view, and houses different versions of ourselves.

And those "stuck" troubles we encounter are like a leaky kitchen on the second floor. If we just stand on the second floor, busy mopping and bailing with buckets, we might find the leak getting worse, eventually flooding even the bedroom. That's because the root of the leak might be in the fifth-floor bathroom, an old faucet named "I don't deserve a good life" that wasn't properly turned off.

So, just circling the floor where the problem occurs won't solve anything. We need a blueprint of this building and an old-fashioned elevator that can go up and down. We need to go upstairs to see the views, and also go down to the basement storage to look through old things.

In the time to come, I invite you to join me as a mental explorer. We'll bring no judgment, just a pot of good tea and full marks for curiosity, to push open every closed door in this building. From the first-floor game room full of complaints, to the fourth-floor bridge with its magical compass, and then to the top-floor garden where you can see a sky full of stars...

We'll go and see which floor that "stuck" self is trapped on. Then, we'll walk over, gently pat their shoulder, offer them a cup of hot tea, and say, "Hey, I'm here. Don't be afraid, it's a bit winding here, getting lost is normal. Let's take the elevator up and see the view together."

Ready? Our exploration begins now!

### Chapter One: Ground Floor Lobby · The Complaining Game Room (Environment Level)

"Ding—"

With a somewhat vintage sound, like an old toaster popping up, our building's elevator smoothly stopped on the first floor.

The elevator doors slowly slid open, and we arrived at the first level of this mental building.

Wow, it's so bright here! The entire space is like a huge, spotless glass bubble, with large, bright floor-to-ceiling windows everywhere. The view outside is unobstructed: bustling roads, hurried pedestrians, the buzzing cranes on a distant construction site, and the sky above, sometimes clear, sometimes gloomy. The light here is exceptionally good, almost dazzling.

The people in the room each have an incredibly comfortable-looking rocking chair. The chairs are exquisitely designed; once you sit down, you're enveloped by a gentle force, comfortably facing away from the center of the room and towards the window. Their postures are strikingly consistent: leaning back, brows slightly furrowed, right index finger firmly pointing out the window, muttering to themselves, as if participating in a grand, silent chorus.

"Look, look, another traffic jam! I knew I'd be late today, it's all this damn traffic!" A young man in a plaid shirt with somewhat messy hair—let's call him Ah Wei—said indignantly to the person next to him. He was supposed to meet a very important client today, and because of this traffic jam, he felt like a multi-million dollar contract had already flown away on wings.

"Exactly," echoed a capable-looking woman with her hair in a bun next to him—let's call her Sister Lin. She pointed to an office building outside the window and said, "My proposal was rejected by the boss again today, he just doesn't get it! I pulled three all-nighters to create a minimalist design, and he insisted it 'wasn't grand enough,' telling me to add colorful black and a spinning, jumping logo. How am I supposed to work like this?"

"And my roommate, oh my god, he's a disaster! His socks can stand up by themselves, and his takeout boxes can cultivate new ecosystems, I feel like I'm living in a landfill!" A girl wearing noise-canceling headphones took them off and excitedly joined the conversation. She felt that all her creative inspiration had been sucked away by that pile of dirty clothes.

This is our first stop—the "Complaining Game Room."

The residents here are particularly good at a game called "It's All Your Fault." Their eyes are like high-precision radars, always scanning for every imperfection in the external environment: weather, traffic, boss, colleagues, family, friends... even if the soy milk at the breakfast shop isn't sweet enough today, it can become irrefutable proof of their bad mood for the day.

Their catchphrase is: "If only..."

"If only the weather were good today, my mood wouldn't be so bad."
"If only the boss weren't so picky, my project would have succeeded long ago."
"If only I were born into a wealthy family, I wouldn't have to work so hard."

These "if onlys" are like small doors leading to an imagined perfect world, but they only stand at the entrance and look, never stepping inside. Because complaining is much easier and safer than changing.

Does this sound familiar? To be honest, I confess, I used to be a regular at this game room, the kind with an annual pass.

My friend Xiao Tuan was once a VIP player in this game room, with a rank high enough to teach classes.

Xiao Tuan is a very talented UI designer, whose dream is to create an app as simple and elegant as a work of art. But after graduation, he joined a company that specializes in creating "high-end, grand, and classy" applications for "money-is-no-object" clients.

Thus, his daily life became a tragic tug-of-war.

"Ring, ring—" As soon as his alarm rang, he'd pick up his phone to check the work group chat. If the boss had sent some "idea" at three in the morning, he'd sigh: "Ugh, back to that hellhole again."
Before leaving, he'd check the weather forecast. If it was a sunny day, he'd say, "So annoying, it's so hot, I'll be sweating as soon as I step out." If it was rainy, he'd say, "Oh no, there'll definitely be traffic, and my shoes will get soaked." In short, no weather pleased him.

At the office, if it was quiet, he'd find the atmosphere oppressive, making him feel suffocated. If colleagues were chatting, he'd find them too noisy, distracting him from his focus on "pixel-perfect alignment."

When the boss asked him to discuss a proposal, his internal drama theater would automatically play a high-definition, bullet-commentary version: "Here we go again, time for more nitpicking. He doesn't understand whitespace or a sense of space, he'll just point fingers with his outdated aesthetic of 'make the text bigger, the color redder.'"

Once, he sent me a WeChat voice message past eleven at night, with the sound of frantic typing in the background.
"Guess what I'm still doing?" His voice was filled with exhaustion and anger.
"Still revising that 'colorful black'?" I asked.
"Exactly! The client said the logo wasn't prominent enough, and the boss told me to add a neon dynamic effect, preferably with 3D rotation! Oh my god, this is a health app for middle-aged and elderly people! Do they want users to have a heart attack on the spot? This aesthetic, this environment, I'm really fed up! I feel like my talent is being murdered little by little in this hellhole. There's nothing I can do, the environment is just like this, what can I do?"

You see, this is the biggest trap of living on the first floor—the swamp of "powerlessness."

This swamp, on the surface, looks safe, even a bit comfortable. Because as long as you stay in it, no problems are your problems, and no failures are your responsibility. You are always the innocent, pitiful victim persecuted by a bad environment. This feeling of being on a "moral high ground" can sometimes be quite addictive.

But stay too long, and you'll find yourself slowly sinking. When our gaze is always outward, attributing the cause of all problems to the external environment, we are actually handing over the remote control of our lives to others. We become puppets on strings: the weather is a string, the boss is a string, traffic is a string... any slight disturbance can easily manipulate our emotions.

We feel trapped, unable to move, filled with helpless anger and grievance.

But dear explorer, we must also see the treasure of this floor.

Clearly seeing the impact of the environment on us is the first step towards growth. Residents of the first floor often possess very keen perception. They are like brilliant detectives, able to accurately find all clues at the crime scene. Recognizing that "traffic jams indeed affect mood" and "a picky boss indeed increases work difficulty" shows that we are not living in a vacuum; we have deep insights into reality.

This sensitivity is a gift. It allows us to feel the complexity and subtlety of the world.

This is important.

However, a good detective, after collecting clues, doesn't sit at the crime scene complaining that there are too many and too messy. He pins all the clues onto a whiteboard, then steps back and begins to think: "Based on these clues, what should I do next?"

So, the first floor is a great starting point, but we can't live here forever.

We need to acknowledge the power of the environment, but not surrender to it. We need to slowly and gently pull back the finger pointing out the window and look at our own palm. Then, get up from that comfortable rocking chair that makes you not want to leave, and turn around.

You'll discover for the first time that in the center of this room, there has always been an antique bronze-colored, faintly glowing old elevator. It's always been there, we just never looked back at it.

Come, let's press that slightly cool button with the upward arrow together.

### Chapter Two: Second Floor Workshop · The Busy Hamster Wheel (Behavior Level)

"Ding—"

The elevator doors slowly slid open again, and a wave of heat, mixed with sweat, oil, and a certain fervent aura, rushed towards us.

This place is a world apart from the leisurely glass room on the first floor where one could enjoy afternoon tea. Before our eyes is a huge, brightly lit workshop, filled with the "thump-thump-thump" of hammering, the "sizzle-sizzle-sizzle" of welding, and people cheering themselves on. Everyone is like a wind-up toy soldier, with "Struggle" headbands on their foreheads, constantly in motion.

They no longer complain; this is a huge step forward! They've pulled back the fingers that once pointed out the window, clenching them tightly into fists, with two large characters painted in red on their palms: "Action!"

The residents here believe in "no pain, no gain" and "great effort creates miracles." Their catchphrase is: "I haven't done enough."

"My performance isn't good, it must be because I haven't visited enough clients!" A salesperson named Ah Qiang was on the phone facing a wall, which was covered with "Today's Goal: 200 Calls" slogans. His phone receiver was polished bright by the sweat in his palm.

"I've gained three pounds again, it must be because I haven't exercised hard enough!" A girl named Xiao Mei was sweating profusely on a treadmill, having set the speed to a level where she was almost flying off, muttering to herself: "Burn my calories!"

"My child only scored 98 this time, it must be because I haven't supervised his homework long enough!" A mother, holding an exercise book thicker than a brick, with a furrowed brow, was planning her child's next hour of study tasks.

Remember Xiao Tuan, who successfully escaped from the "Complaining Game Room" on the first floor? He got up from that comfortable rocking chair, walked into the elevator, and ambitiously pressed the button for the second floor.

He told himself: "No more complaining! From today onwards, my destiny is in my hands, not heaven's! I'm going to take action and change everything!"

And so, Xiao Tuan's life was like a videotape played at 16x speed.

To avoid the morning rush hour, he set his alarm from 7:30 to 6:00. Before dawn, he was already rushing out the door, buying two steamed buns downstairs, stuffing them into his mouth as he ran, squeezing onto the rush-hour subway like a gust of wind. He felt that by using others' sleeping time for commuting, he was already ahead of the curve.

To satisfy his boss and clients, he no longer argued. When the boss said "the logo needs to be colorful black," he gritted his teeth and said, "Okay, boss, no problem, boss"; when the client said "it still doesn't feel grand enough," he smiled and said, "You're right, I'll revise it immediately." The light in his office was always the last one to go out in the entire building. He even bought a cot for the office, ready to battle until dawn at any moment.

To improve himself, he enrolled in a bunch of online courses, filling his free time to the brim. He watched while eating, listened while walking, and even used bathroom breaks. His phone saved hundreds of short videos like "Learn XXX in 3 minutes" and "10 tips to make you XXX," making him feel like he was absorbing massive amounts of knowledge every day.

Xiao Tuan indeed changed. He became busier, worked harder, and... became more exhausted.

He was like a spinning top, whipped by his own hand, rotating at high speed, unable to stop. He thought that if he spun fast enough, he could create an updraft and fly. But he gradually found that he was just spinning in place, and his head was getting dizzier, with everything starting to appear as double vision.

His design proposals were revised eight hundred times, yet they still didn't impress his boss and clients. They always came up with new "feelings."
His body, due to chronic sleep deprivation and irregular meals, began to frequently send out alarms. Stomach pain, dizziness, and insomnia became his daily companions.
Most of the courses he enrolled in were only listened to for a start and then never opened again. The short videos he saved just lay quietly in his list, like a pile of unread old newspapers.

One late night, he messaged me again; it was almost two in the morning. This time, there was no angry voice message, just a short line of incredibly fragile-looking text.
He said: "I've worked so hard, why is it still not working? Am I really that stupid?"

You see, this is the second floor's trap—the "brute force" trap, or the "busy hamster wheel."

When we shift from complaining to action, it's a remarkable leap. We begin to realize that happiness and success cannot be gained by waiting and blaming; they must be fought for ourselves. We've reclaimed a part of life's steering wheel from others' hands, holding it tightly in our own. This deserves our enthusiastic applause!

This is the second floor's most precious treasure—the willingness and power to act. All great stories begin with "doing." Without action, even the most beautiful blueprint is just waste paper. The residents of the second floor are true warriors; they dare to declare war on life.

However, if there's only action, it's like a sports car with an F1 engine but no steering wheel, only furiously burning rubber in place, emitting plumes of black smoke, and making deafening roars. It seems grand, but goes nowhere.

Effort is a very, very valuable quality. But blind effort is an extremely cruel form of self-consumption. It acts like a black hole, draining our enthusiasm, eroding our confidence, and ultimately leading us from "it's all the world's fault" to another abyss—"it's all my fault."

Like Xiao Tuan, he desperately "did," but rarely paused to ask himself: "Am I doing it 'right'?" "Is there a better 'way' to do it?"

He thought that by pressing the accelerator all the way down, he could reach his destination. But he didn't realize that he might have been circling endlessly on a huge, exit-less circular track. The faster he ran, the further he got from the finish line.

So, dear explorer, when you find yourself working hard but feeling powerless, busy but without a sense of accomplishment, perhaps you need to step out of this bustling workshop and look for a more advanced elevator.

We need to go to a quieter place, look at a map, find some tools, and equip our sports car with a sensitive steering wheel and a GPS navigation system.

Come, take a deep breath, untie your headband, and wipe away the sweat. Let's head to the third floor together.

### Chapter Three: Third Floor Study · The Magical Toolbox (Capability Level)

"Ding—"

The elevator doors opened again; this time, there was no heat wave, no complaints. A tranquil scent mixed with old books, wood, and a faint hint of coffee wafted over, instantly soothing the anxiety and fatigue we had accumulated in the second-floor workshop.

This is a huge, high-ceilinged duplex study, more like a wizard's secret attic. Tall bookshelves stretch from the floor deep into the unseen ceiling, packed with all sorts of books, from "How to Learn Like a Sponge" to "Communication Magic to Talk to Anyone," from "Code Complete" to "An Actor Prepares."

The walls are adorned with various complex flowcharts, colorful mind maps, and even some peculiar diagrams that look like martial arts manuals, such as a drawing of a small figure with "Five-Step Fist for Emotional Freedom" written next to it. On the floor are scattered various toolboxes, some labeled "Time Management," others "Emotional First Aid," and one sparkling, transparent crystal box with a small inscription: "Creativity Engine, Handle with Care."

The residents here are completely different from those downstairs. They don't complain, nor do they act recklessly. Each holds a small notebook for jotting down inspirations at any time, their eyes gleaming with curiosity and exploration. They believe in one saying: "There's always a way."

Their catchphrase is: "How can I do it better?" or "Is there a better way?"

"This project is too complex, how can I break it down into smaller, actionable tasks, like Lego bricks?" A girl wearing rimless glasses stood in front of a large whiteboard, drawing a complex mind map with different colored markers.

"My speech was a disaster again; as soon as I got on stage, my heart raced and my palms sweated. How can I overcome this nervousness and express myself more confidently?" A boy in a hoodie was sitting on a corner sofa, seriously reading a book called "The Art of Public Speaking," occasionally waving his hand in the air as if practicing.

"I always lose my temper, and I regret it terribly every time I argue with my family. Is there any method that can help me manage my emotions better, instead of being led by them?" A woman in yoga pants was sitting cross-legged on a meditation cushion, taking a card from a toolbox labeled "Emotional First Aid," which read "Pause-Breathe-Feel-Respond."

This is the "Magical Toolbox" on the third floor.

Our friend Xiao Tuan, who was almost exhausted from running on the second floor, finally dragged his tired body, panting, to this place.

When he pushed open the heavy oak door on the third floor, he was stunned. He felt as if he were Harry Potter entering Diagon Alley for the first time; everything before his eyes shimmered with magical light.

"So... solving problems isn't just about working oneself to death!" he murmured, his voice tinged with a hint of grievance and immense relief.

And so, Xiao Tuan, like a compressed sponge dropped into water, began to furiously absorb the nourishment here at an astonishing speed.

He no longer pulled all-nighters; instead, from a toolbox labeled "Pomodoro Technique," he learned how to divide his work time into 25-minute focused sprints and 5-minute rest breaks, like setting game levels. He found that his concentration had improved like never before.

He no longer blindly said "okay" to his boss and clients; instead, from a book called "Nonviolent Communication," he learned how to, like a detective, first observe the facts, then express his feelings and needs, and finally make specific requests. Once, faced with the boss's request for "colorful black," he didn't hold his breath and revise the draft as before. Instead, he said: "Boss, I understand you want this logo to be both steady and lively (observation and feeling). But I'm concerned that using too many highly saturated colors simultaneously in one interface might cause user eye fatigue and affect the app's professional feel (need). What if we try using a deep blue as the main color, then one or two bright colors as accents (request)?" After listening, the boss paused, then surprisingly said, "Hmm... you have a point. Why don't you make a version for me to see?"

He no longer spent all his spare time "attending classes"; instead, he learned to use the "Feynman Technique" to explain what he learned in the simplest plain language to friends who knew nothing about the field. He found that much of the knowledge he thought he "understood" was full of holes when he tried to explain it. This process truly helped him internalize the knowledge.

A miracle happened.

Xiao Tuan's work efficiency was surprisingly high. He consistently completed tasks ahead of schedule, and the quality of his proposals improved steadily. The boss even started praising him by name in meetings. He had more time to exercise, socialize, watch movies, and even picked up his favorite guitar from college again. The smiles on his face also increased, no longer the tense, forced smiles to cope with others.

He felt like a martial arts master who had unblocked his meridians; difficulties that once seemed insurmountable now seemed to have solutions.

This is the treasure of the third floor—infinite possibilities.

It tells us that we are natural learners, and our brains possess astonishing plasticity. 90% of the dilemmas we encounter have actually been faced by those before us, who have summarized countless effective "strategies" and "tools." We don't have to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time.

Learning to ask for help, learning to use tools, learning to stand on the shoulders of giants—this is wisdom, not weakness. It allows us to break free from low-level repetition and apply our valuable energy where creativity is truly needed.

But, dear explorer, have you noticed that this magical toolbox also hides a sweet trap?

Xiao Tuan soon encountered new confusion. He became a "methodology master," his favorites folder filled with various practical articles and course links. When chatting with friends, he couldn't go three sentences without mentioning various models and theories.

If a friend broke up, he'd say: "Don't be sad, you can try using the 'ABC Model of Emotion' to analyze your irrational beliefs."
If a friend hit a career bottleneck, he'd say: "I suggest you use 'SWOT analysis' to review and identify your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats."

He became increasingly "correct" and "efficient," but deep down, that small void didn't seem to be filled. Occasionally, in the dead of night, he would ask himself: "I've learned so many dragon-slaying techniques, but... where is my dragon? Why am I slaying dragons?"

He was like a chef who had collected countless expensive kitchen utensils but didn't know for whom or what kind of meal he wanted to cook.

This is the third floor's trap—the "Dragon Slayer's Blade Collector."

We become obsessed with collecting and learning various "techniques," but forget to contemplate the "tao" (the way). We are busy finding "how to do," but forget to ask "why do."

Capability is the means of transport that helps us reach our destination. But if there's no destination in mind, even the fastest sports car will just idle in place.

So, when we've mastered enough tools, it's time to look for a map, a compass. We need to go to a higher place, listen to our inner voice, and find the direction we truly want to go.

Come, let's put the toolbox down for a moment and continue upwards.

---

### Chapter Four: Fourth Floor Bridge · The Captain's Compass (Beliefs/Values Level)

"Ding—"

This time, when the elevator doors opened, there was no noise, no heat wave, and no scholarly air.

We seemed to step onto the bridge of a large ship sailing at midnight. The room was circular, windowless, with deep sea-blue walls all around, dotted with twinkling starlight, like the deep ocean at night. In the center, a soft beam of light shone down from the ceiling, illuminating a heavy antique bronze ship's wheel and a faintly glowing brass compass beside it.

There was almost no one here, making it exceptionally quiet. But if you listened carefully, you could hear faint yet firm sounds, like a heartbeat emanating from deep within the walls, or the chime of a distant lighthouse.

"What is truly important?"
"What do I truly believe?"
"Why am I doing this?"

These voices are not heard with the ears, but with the heart.

This is the command center of the entire building—the fourth-floor bridge. It determines where our life's ship is ultimately headed.

The residents here no longer care about "how to do," but rather question "why do." They are the captains of their own lives.

Remember Xiao Tuan, our "Dragon Slayer's Blade Collector"? When he arrived on the fourth floor with his sparkling toolboxes, he felt truly lost for the first time.

He stood before the large compass, its needle spinning wildly like it was drunk, unable to stop. He didn't know where to steer the ship. He possessed the skills to slay dragons, yet found he had no dragons to slay, or rather, he didn't know in which waters his dragon resided.

For the first time, he began to ask himself questions he had never considered, or even deliberately avoided.

"Why do I work so hard? Is it to gain my boss's approval? Or to earn money to buy a bigger house? Or simply because I'm afraid of being called lazy by others?"
"Why do I find 'stopping' to be a terrifying thing? Is it because deep down I believe that a person's worth is equal to how busy they are?"
"What is the ultimate purpose of my pursuit of 'efficiency' and 'correctness'? Is it to make life easier, or just to win an imagined competition against others?"

These questions, like small, sharp scalpels, precisely cut through the hard shell he had built with "efficiency" and "methods." Behind the shell, he saw a soft, fragile self he had never seen before.

He discovered that deep within him lay some "life tenets" he wasn't even aware of. They were like the underlying code of a computer, silently controlling all his decisions without his notice.

For example, he had a deeply rooted belief: "I must be perfect to be loved."

This belief might have come from an experience in childhood when he scored 98 but was still scolded by his parents; or it might have come from a teacher's comment, "You're smart, but a bit careless." It had lurked like a ghost for many years.

It was this belief that made him desperately try to perform at work, fear making mistakes, dare not ask for help, and bear all the pressure himself.
It was this belief that made him cautious in relationships, afraid to show his vulnerable side, always wanting to play the role of the omnipotent one.
It was this belief that made him spin like a top, because he believed that once he stopped, he would no longer be "perfect" and thus unworthy of love.

You see, this is the fourth floor's trap—the "invisible chains."

These beliefs, values, and rules hidden in our subconscious are like invisible chains. They might come from our childhood experiences, from our parents' teachings, from societal expectations. Many times, they protect us, but as we grow up, they can also become shackles that limit our progress.

We don't even feel their presence, only that the path of life becomes heavier and more tiring with each step, yet we don't know why.

But at the same time, this floor also holds the most powerful treasure in the entire building—inner drive, or what we often call "original intention."

When Xiao Tuan finally gathered the courage to confront those chains and tried to unburden himself of them, he suddenly felt lighter. He gently said to the "must be perfect" belief: "Thank you for protecting me all these years, but now, I've grown up, and I can protect myself."

He began to establish some new beliefs for himself. He told himself:
"My worth is not tied to whether I am perfect. I am inherently worthy of love."
"Completion is more important than perfection. Shoot first, then aim."
"Creating designs that move people brings me more joy than getting praise from my boss."

As he carved these new beliefs, word by word, onto the compass with a small knife, a miracle happened. The wildly spinning needle slowly, slowly stabilized, pointing to a clear direction, on which was written: "Create and Share."

At that moment, Xiao Tuan suddenly understood.

All the tools and methods he had learned on the third floor finally found their purpose. They were no longer dragon-slaying blades for showing off, but had become his paintbrushes, carving knives, and colors for creating and sharing.

His work was no longer about proving himself, but had transformed into a joyful game of creation. He began to enjoy every step of the design process, savoring the delight of bringing an idea to life.

When our actions (second floor) and our capabilities (third floor) "align" with our deepest beliefs (fourth floor), an incredibly powerful, continuous inner strength is awakened.

We no longer need to "persevere" through willpower, because everything we do, we do out of genuine "willingness" from our hearts. We no longer feel tired, because we are not consuming energy, but creating it.

This feeling is called "flow," also known as "happiness."

But, dear explorer, the story doesn't end here. Once the compass has a direction, the captain still needs to answer an ultimate question.

"Who am I?"

"Who am I, as the captain of this ship?"

This question requires us to seek answers in an even more mysterious place.

Come, with curiosity about ourselves, let's continue upwards to visit the fifth-floor gallery.

---

### Chapter Five: Fifth Floor Gallery · Mirror, Mirror, Tell Me (Identity Level)

"Ding—"

The elevator doors opened, and we arrived at a completely different place.

There are no machines here, no books, no compass. This is a long, quiet gallery, carpeted with soft, sound-absorbing deep red carpet. On the walls hang mirror after mirror, with frames of various styles: some are ornate gold relief, some are simple modern wood, and some have no frame at all, like a pool of clear water embedded in the wall.

Strangely, when you stand before any mirror, it doesn't reflect your current appearance.

You walk up to an old-fashioned wooden-framed mirror, and in it might appear a version of you wearing overalls, planting tomatoes in a field, with satisfied sweat on your face.
You turn and look at another mirror inlaid with shells; the you in the mirror might have become an explorer with a huge backpack, standing atop a snow-capped mountain, with determined eyes.
Change to another one, and the you in the mirror might be wearing a white lab coat, intently mixing something in a laboratory, with a serious and focused expression.

This is the "Magic Mirror Gallery" on the fifth floor. It answers only one question, also the most important one: "Who am I?"

The residents here are those who have found their life's direction (fourth floor) and have begun to contemplate their "existence" itself. They no longer ask "why do," but instead begin to define "who I am, therefore I do."

Our Xiao Tuan, who had found his direction of "creating and sharing," also arrived here.

He stood at the entrance of the gallery, somewhat at a loss. He habitually walked towards what seemed like the most ordinary mirror, which hung in the most inconspicuous corner, its frame gray, like an office partition.

In the mirror appeared an image he was all too familiar with: a "tired worker." The him in the mirror was hunched over, his eyes dim, clutching a coffee cup tightly as if it were a lifeline.

Xiao Tuan looked at himself in the mirror, his heart sinking. He thought: "Yes, this is me. I'm just a worker who commutes daily, revises proposals, and deals with the boss." The moment this thought appeared, he felt his strength instantly drained again, and the light that had finally brightened on the fourth-floor compass dimmed.

He sat dejectedly on the carpet, not daring to look at any other mirror.

Just then, a voice whispered in his ear: "My dear, why do you only look at that one mirror?"

Xiao Tuan looked up and found an elderly lady with white hair standing beside him, gently looking at him.

"Each of these mirrors is a possibility," the old lady said with a smile. "Why don't you try standing in front of another mirror?"

Xiao Tuan hesitated for a moment, but finally gathered his courage and stood up. He carefully walked around the "worker" mirror and approached another mirror adorned with many musical notes and colors.

He took a deep breath and looked into the mirror.

In the mirror, a brand new him appeared. This him wasn't sitting in a cubicle, but at a wide wooden table, which was covered with paints, brushes, and all sorts of curious materials. He was intently painting a small clay figure with a brush, a smile playing on his lips that he himself hadn't noticed. His eyes, no longer tired, sparkled with curiosity and joy, like a child discovering a new toy.

Below the mirror, there was a small label that read: "A creative life artist."

Xiao Tuan was stunned. He looked at himself in the mirror, his heart pounding. A wonderful feeling surged within him. He suddenly realized, "Right, isn't this also me? I love to create, I enjoy the process of turning an idea into reality, I can be a 'life artist' too!"

This thought, like a seed, fell into his heart.

From that day on, Xiao Tuan's entire state changed.

He was still a designer, but he no longer considered himself just a "worker." When he began to work as a "life artist," his approach to tasks was completely different.

To find inspiration, he would visit art museums on weekends instead of staying home playing games.
To better present his creativity, he would proactively learn new software and skills.
He even started sharing some of his design insights and small creative ideas from his life on his social media, attracting a small group of loyal followers.

His work was no longer a "task that had to be completed," but a natural expression of his identity as a "life artist."

You see, this is the treasure of the fifth floor—the magic of self-reinvention.

"Who am I" has never been a true/false question, but a multiple-choice one. Our past experiences, professions, and roles can label us in various ways, such as "an introverted person," "a failure," "a good student"...

And the trap of the fifth floor is "labeling oneself." We often cling to one of these labels, especially negative ones, and then tell ourselves: "See, this is who I am, I can't change." This label, like the Golden Headband spell on Sun Wukong, firmly traps us in place, limiting all our possibilities.

But the magic mirror on the fifth floor tells us that we are far broader and richer than any single label.

Identity is not a result, but a choice. It's a perspective, a way we see ourselves. When we choose to view ourselves with a new, more positive, and more empowering identity, we open a whole new script for our lives.

This new identity will act like a powerful magnetic field, automatically attracting beliefs (fourth floor), capabilities (third floor), and behaviors (second floor) that align with it.

A "practitioner of healthy living" will naturally choose healthy foods and stick to exercise.
A "lifelong learner" will naturally view reading and learning as something as natural as breathing.

But, dear explorer, do you think this is the end?

As Xiao Tuan, in his identity as a "life artist," created more and more beautiful things and shared them, he began to feel something grander. He discovered that his own happiness could illuminate others' happiness. His own creations could become a glimmer of light in this world.

He began to ponder a more ultimate question: "What is my relationship with this world, as a 'life artist'? What is the true meaning of my existence?"

To answer this question, we need to go to the highest point of this building.

Come, with curiosity about ourselves, let's continue upwards to visit the top-floor garden.

### Chapter Six: Top Floor Garden · The Telescope Under the Starry Sky (Spirit/System Level)

"Ding—"

This time, the elevator doors didn't open; instead, the ceiling slowly rose upwards. We arrived at an open-air secret garden.

Underfoot was soft green grass, carrying the scent of earth. There were no magnificent exotic flowers in the garden, only some humble, nameless small wildflowers gently swaying in the evening breeze. In the center of the garden stood a large, ancient astronomical telescope, its barrel pointing directly at the deep night sky.

Standing here, you can overlook the familiar city below, brilliantly lit, like a flowing river of light. You can also clearly hear the hammering from the workshop downstairs, the rustling of books from the study, and even the faint complaints from the first-floor game room.

But when you look up, you'll see an unprecedented, incredibly brilliant galaxy. Every star is so bright, so distant; together, they form a grand and serene tableau.

This is the "Starry Sky Garden" on the sixth floor. The question it answers transcends ourselves. It asks: "What is my relationship with everything beyond myself?"

The residents here are those who have begun to contemplate "mission." They no longer focus solely on personal growth but start to consider how to integrate their own light into the broader sea of stars.

Our newly appointed "life artist" Xiao Tuan also finally arrived here.

He walked through this garden with his new identity found in the fifth-floor gallery and his passion for creation. At first, he was a bit puzzled. There were no tools here, no mirrors, no compass, only a silent starry sky. What could he do?

He tried pointing the large telescope at the brightest star in the night sky.

As his eye peered into the eyepiece, he saw an incredible sight. He didn't see an isolated star, but a vast galaxy composed of countless stars, mutually attracted and rotating together. He suddenly understood that the brightest star, the reason it was so dazzling, was not only because it emitted its own light but also because it was part of this magnificent galaxy, resonating with billions of other stars.

Then, he turned the telescope towards the brightly lit city below.

He saw a designer just like him, thrilled by a creative idea late at night.
He saw a mother patiently talking to her rebellious child, using the communication skills she had just learned.
He saw a young person, having let go of complaints, entering a gym for the first time, sweating profusely on the treadmill.

He saw countless people, just like him, striving to climb within their own mental buildings. He saw their joy, struggles, confusion, and courage. He saw all these tiny, personal stories converge to form the vibrant pulse of the city.

At that moment, Xiao Tuan's eyes welled up.

He suddenly realized that his meaning as a "life artist" was not just about making himself happy. When he carefully designed a poster, it might warm someone who passed by; when he shared an article about creation, it might ignite a spark in another young designer's heart; when he lived a more expansive, joyful state through his own actions, he himself became a mirror for those around him, allowing them to see another possibility.

He was a small but indispensable part of this vast system. His existence was closely connected to and influenced by this world.

This is the treasure of the sixth floor—finding a sense of mission.

When we expand the boundaries of "I" and begin to think of "we," a serene and powerful force, transcending personal joys and sorrows, descends upon us. We will no longer completely negate ourselves because of a single failure, nor will we become complacent because of a single success. Because we know that everything we do is merely adding a small, yet unique, beam of light to this brilliant galaxy.

This sense of mission will become the most solid foundation of our lives, allowing us to maintain inner peace and certainty when facing any storm.

But, dear explorer, you must have guessed that this highest, most beautiful floor also hides the trap easiest to get lost in.

That is the "cloud of the armchair philosopher."

Some people come here, awestruck by the vastness of the starry sky, and so they start lying in the garden every day, contemplating the mysteries of the universe and discussing the future of humanity. They talk about love and peace, compassion and wisdom, their words filled with lofty philosophy.

But they forget to water the wildflowers at their feet, forget that their family downstairs still needs their company, forget the work they initially promised to complete. They fall in love with the feeling of "talking about mission," but forget that any grand mission must be implemented through the smallest, most concrete actions.

They float in the clouds, disconnected from their roots. This is actually another form of escape, fundamentally no different from complaining about the environment while living on the first floor.

Therefore, a truly mature explorer will not stay on the sixth floor forever.

He will often come here to calibrate his direction and draw strength from the starry sky. Then, carrying this strength, he will take the elevator back to any floor he needs to be on.

He will return to the second-floor workshop, using the sense of mission brought from the sixth floor to inject meaning into his mundane actions.
He will return to the first-floor game room, using the broad perspective gained from the sixth floor to understand and accept those who are still complaining.

He, finally, gained the ability to freely navigate within this building.

So, does our exploration end here?

No, my dear.

After we've explored all the floors, learned how to reconcile with every imperfect version of ourselves, and learned how to freely use the elevator, there's one last thing we need to do.

That is, to walk to the first floor, find the main door we never noticed at first, and then, gently, push it open.

Outside the door is warm sunlight, the scent of grass, the laughter of children, and the rustling of wind through leaves.

Outside the door is real life.

This mental building is our inner navigation system, an excellent self-diagnostic tool. But it's not the whole world. We explore it to live better, not to live in it forever.

Sometimes, the best choice is to forget all the theories, all the models, all the levels.

It's about truly feeling the warmth of the sun, embracing someone you love, cheering for a delicious meal, and running freely in the rain just once.

Because, inward exploration is ultimately so that we can step into the outer world more bravely, more authentically, and more lovingly.

This exploration has no end.

And the exploration itself is the most beautiful scenery.

Thank you, dear explorer, for accompanying me on this journey. Now, let's push open the door together and step into the sunlight.
