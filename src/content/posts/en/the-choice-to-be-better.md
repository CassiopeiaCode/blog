## Introduction: Our Long Pursuit of Happiness

It was a late autumn night, with a hint of just the right chill in the air. My old friend Chang Yuan and I met at a quiet bar with a river view. The bustling city below us transformed into a silent, glittering galaxy of stars. We talked about many things, from our youthful ideals to the trivialities of the present. After a few rounds of drinks, his face, usually adorned with a polite smile, gradually revealed an undeniable weariness.

He leaned back on the sofa, letting out a long sigh as if shedding a thousand pounds of burden. He turned to look at the illusory prosperity outside the window, his voice tinged with a confusion I had never heard before: "What is all this for, anyway?"

I knew his story. In others' eyes, Chang Yuan was the quintessential "life winner." Graduating from a prestigious university, he carved out a successful career in a big city, owning his own company, a warm family, a car, and a house. His social media feed was always filled with enviable updates: newly signed big deals, family trips, his children's excellent report cards. He was like a precise machine, always climbing upwards, never failing.

"I seem to have everything," he swirled the amber liquid in his glass, the ice cubes clinking crisply, "but I don't feel like anything truly belongs to me. Every morning I wake up, not by some damn dream, but by an alarm. That sound keeps ringing—'You're falling behind, you're being left behind.'"

He paused, his eyes hollow: "I run desperately, thinking the finish line is ahead, but after one hill, I find there's an even higher mountain. I don't even dare to stop and ask myself if I truly enjoy climbing mountains. I'm just afraid, afraid that once I stop, I'll be swallowed by the crowd behind me."

Chang Yuan's story, like a needle, precisely pierced the pain point of our era. We seem to be in an infinite game arena, with vague rules and a distant finish line, yet everyone is running frantically, fearing elimination.

A few years ago, the country of Bhutan suddenly entered public consciousness. This small nation at the southern foot of the Himalayas, not abundant in material wealth, was nonetheless lauded as having the "highest global happiness index." For a time, it became a "Shangri-La" in many people's minds. I don't wish to portray Bhutan as a utopian paradise detached from worldly concerns; in fact, I know it faces its own challenges brought by modernization. But its existence is more like a highly polished mirror handed to us.

On one side of the mirror is a relatively simple material life and the pure, clear smiles on people's faces. On the other side is our world of unprecedented material abundance, where the glass curtain walls of skyscrapers reflect hurried faces filled with anxiety.

This mirror mercilessly reflects a huge paradox, asking each of us: Are we truly pursuing happiness itself with all our striving and desperate chasing? Or are we merely chasing the illusion of "appearing happier than others"?

This question was most vividly embodied a few years ago in an article that went viral across the internet—"Your Peers Are Abandoning You." This article acted like a potent anxiety catalyst, precisely injected into the veins of every urban dweller. Subsequently, various satirical memes emerged:

"Puyi ascended the throne at 3, your peers are abandoning you."
"Xiang Yu led an uprising at 24, your peers are abandoning you."
"Bill Gates is worth hundreds of billions at 60, your peers are abandoning you."

Behind these seemingly jocular words lies a collective, profound helplessness. We know this is absurd, yet we can't help but project ourselves into it. We are pushed by an invisible hand onto an endless stage of comparison. We compare grades, positions, salaries, house sizes, and even whose children are more outstanding or whose vacation looks more enjoyable.

The paradox of this competition is that there are no winners. Because no matter how high you stand on a mountaintop, there will always be a higher peak vaguely appearing in the clouds. Consequently, inner peace and joy are utterly consumed in this never-ending pursuit.

Tonight, Chang Yuan's monologue, and the weariness of thousands upon thousands of silent "Chang Yuans" behind it, made me feel it necessary to embark on a deep inner exploration. Can we find a path to freedom from this destiny of "comparison," doubly imposed by genes and society, where we are involuntary participants?

Perhaps the answer lies behind that most fundamental question: What exactly is that invisible hand that pushes us onto the playing field?

## **Part One: The Invisible Arena: Why We Are Not Our Own Masters**

### **Chapter One: The Ancient Echo of Survival: The "Comparison" Program in Our Blood**

To understand why we are involuntary participants in this invisible competition, we might need to shift our gaze from the bustling city back to the ancient wilderness, to listen to the faint yet ceaseless echo from deep within our bloodline.

I once heard a story, repeatedly cited, that serves as a stark allegory, revealing the most primal aspect of human nature.

Two friends were hiking deep in the forest, enjoying the tranquility of nature. Suddenly, a hungry beast appeared before them, letting out a low growl. The shadow of death instantly enveloped them. In the dead silence of fear, one of them didn't choose to run, but quickly took out a pair of lightweight running shoes from his backpack and calmly began to change them.

His companion watched him in despair, his voice trembling as he said, "Are you crazy? Even with new shoes, you can't outrun that beast!"

The friend, tying his laces, replied without looking up, "I don't need to outrun it. I just need to outrun you."

Every time I recall this story, a chill runs down my spine. It's too blunt, even somewhat cruel, for it starkly rips away the veneer of civilization, showing us our most primitive selves, running for survival. We are accustomed to judging the shoe-changer's "selfishness" with morality and reason, but if we shift our perspective back to the millions of years of evolutionary history, we might arrive at a different conclusion.

In an era of scarce food and pervasive danger, survival was the sole theme. Which individuals were more likely to pass on their genes?

The answer is: those individuals who were better at "comparing."

Imagine two primitive tribes. Members of one tribe were content with the status quo; their stone spears were sharp enough, and their caves were reasonably warm. Members of the other tribe, however, were constantly comparing: Luo Yong's spear seemed sharper than mine, I should learn from him, or do better than him; Kabu's cave was higher up, less likely to be discovered by wild beasts, we should look for a similar place.

When harsh winters or fierce saber-toothed tigers arrived, which tribe had a higher probability of survival? The answer is self-evident.

The act of "comparison" is not a bad habit we acquired later in life; it is likely a survival program meticulously encoded by natural selection and built deep within our genes. It functions like a perpetually running alert system, constantly scanning the environment and issuing commands to us:

"Your companion is stronger than you, which means you might lose when competing for food."
"That group's weapons are more advanced than ours, which means we might be annihilated if conflict arises."
"Their territory is more fertile, which means our offspring might not get enough nutrition."

In that era where "survival" trumped everything, this program was our most loyal ally. It kept us vigilant, driving us to imitate, improve, and compete. It was this ceaseless comparison that propelled our ancestors from a primitive existence to slash-and-burn agriculture, ultimately igniting the torch of civilization. It's fair to say that without this built-in "comparison" program, humanity might have long been eliminated in the brutal process of natural selection.

However, the problem lies precisely here.

When we ride the fast train of civilization, entering the information age at a dizzying speed, the iteration rate of our hardware (body and genes) lags far behind the update speed of our software (society and culture). We are using physiological and psychological configurations designed millions of years ago for "survival mode" to run an extremely complex "life mode" application.

This has led to a profound, system-level "incompatibility."

In ancient times, outrunning a companion meant you would survive. Today, seeing a peer buy a bigger house on social media, your body will still honestly secrete stress hormones similar to those for a "survival threat," and your brain will still sound the alarm of "you're falling behind." Yet, in reality, this won't leave you homeless tonight.

In tribal times, obtaining more meat than others was a guarantee of survival. Today, seeing a colleague receive a higher bonus, that primal fear of "resource deprivation" deep within you will still be activated, making you feel anxious and unfairly treated. But in reality, your basic needs are long since met.

That ancient program, which once protected us and allowed us to survive, has become an alarm that is constantly triggered incorrectly in the new era. It is no longer an ally; instead, it has become a bug that continuously generates anxiety and internal friction. We no longer compare to survive, yet we still cannot escape the pain that comparison brings. We are like soldiers who have reached a safe harbor but cannot switch off the wartime alarm, exhausted day in and day out by the piercing noise.

Recognizing this is not to find a fatalistic excuse for our anxiety. On the contrary, it is the first step towards liberation. When you can clearly see that ancient program working ceaselessly deep within you, you gain a valuable "awareness." You begin to understand that the anxiety and pressure arising from comparison are not personal character flaws, nor proof that you are not working hard enough or not good enough, but merely... the automatic execution of an ancient code.

You are not that code. You are the one who can observe the code running. And when you can observe it, you gain the freedom to choose whether or not to be controlled by it.

### **Chapter Two: The Double-Edged Dagger: The Poison of Envy and the Ladder of Admiration**

When that ancient "comparison" program activates within us, it gives rise to two emotions that appear similar yet are fundamentally different. These two emotions, like the two sirens guarding the strait in Homer's epics, tempt passing ships toward vastly different fates.

They are twin sisters, both stemming from the psychological gap of "seeing what he has, and I don't." But one leads you to the abyss of destruction; the other builds a ladder for you to ascend.

These are envy and admiration.

The Chinese character "比" (bǐ, to compare), in its oracle bone script form, resembles two daggers placed side by side. This imagery is terrifyingly precise. When we activate the heart of comparison, it's as if we simultaneously draw these two daggers. One stabs at others, filled with hostility and coldness; the other, more deeply, stabs at ourselves, bringing endless anxiety and self-doubt.

A senior acquaintance of mine, Old Wei, is a typical example of someone whose life was dragged into the mud by the dagger of "envy." Old Wei was an extremely intelligent man, who achieved great success in a technical field early on. His company was once a star in the industry. However, market conditions shifted, and a rising star quickly emerged with a more flexible business model, capturing a significant portion of Old Wei's market share.

From then on, the Old Wei I knew changed.

In the past, when he spoke of industry trends, his eyes held a hunter's keenness and excitement. But later, whenever that competitor was mentioned, his gaze would turn gloomy, and the corners of his mouth would involuntarily twist. He no longer spent time studying the competitor's strengths; instead, he became obsessed with finding their "dirty laundry." He would vividly recount rumors about the competitor's founder at dinner parties, and subtly hint at data fabrication in industry meetings.

At first, we all thought this was just standard business competition. But gradually, things spiraled out of control. He began to pour vast company resources into meaningless smear campaigns, even spending heavily to poach non-core employees from the competitor, just to dig up some inconsequential internal information. His company, like an enraged bull, no longer focused on plowing the field; instead, with bloodshot eyes, it frantically dug up the earth, only wanting to overturn the other bull.

The outcome was predictable. After a brief period of trouble, the rising star, with its solid products and clear strategy, actually garnered more users. Old Wei's company, however, due to strategic deviation and resource misallocation, missed several critical technological transition periods and was eventually marginalized in the market's tide. The last time I saw him was in a corner of an industry forum; he looked much older than his peers, and the light in his eyes had extinguished.

Envy is such a poison. It makes you see not others' excellence, but your own lack. It doesn't motivate you to create; it only incites you to destroy. It diverts your valuable energy from the path of "how to make myself better" into the dead end of "how to prove others are actually bad." Ultimately, the dagger aimed at others might only scratch their skin, while the dagger aimed at yourself has already penetrated deep into your bones.

However, the other side of comparison, "admiration," can exhibit a completely different power.

I recall another friend of mine, Lin Lin. When she first started her career, she was an ordinary designer at an advertising agency. In her team, there was a very talented creative director, almost all award-winning works came from his hand. For a newcomer like Lin Lin, that director was like an unattainable mountain.

Lin Lin also felt immense pressure and frustration. But she didn't let this emotion ferment into envy. She did something very clever: she found all of the director's works, created a folder, and named it "High Mountain." She didn't envy the height of this mountain; instead, she began to study its "geological structure."

She would analyze the director's award-winning proposals one by one, pondering where his ideas came from, why his color schemes were so bold, and what special principles governed his compositions. She even tried to redo the director's classic cases in her own way. After work, she would gather her courage, take her practice pieces, and ask the director for guidance. She would say, "Director, I particularly admire the light and shadow treatment in this work of yours. I tried to imitate it, but it always feels like it's missing something. Could you give me some pointers?"

You rarely hear of anyone refusing such a sincere "admirer."

In this way, Lin Lin transformed her desire of "I want to be that good too" into a solid, actionable learning plan. She dismantled that unattainable mountain into climbable steps. Years later, Lin Lin had long left that company and became the chief designer at another renowned agency, developing her unique style. When she spoke of that director, her tone was still full of gratitude: "He showed me the view from the mountaintop and made me believe that I, too, could have my own climbing path."

Admiration is such a ladder to greater heights. It acknowledges the gap but doesn't wallow in self-pity; it appreciates others' brilliance and uses it to ignite its own torch. It makes us believe that others' excellence is not meant to highlight our inadequacy, but to show us how vast the possibilities of life can be.

It seems the answer is clear: we should put down the poison of envy, pick up the tool of admiration, and strive to build our own towers higher, shouldn't we?

This is indeed a huge step forward, an effective strategy that can make our lives more positive. It can rescue us from the quagmire of internal friction and set us on the path of self-improvement.

But is this truly the ultimate answer?

When we exert all our effort and finally build a tower as tall as, or even taller than, others', will we truly achieve lasting inner peace? Or will we immediately spot another taller building in the distance and plunge into the next, even more exhausting construction project?

We merely transform from a resentful player into a more civilized, more diligent, but equally constrained player by the rules of the game. We are still on the playing field, just adopting a more refined running posture.

If our inner peace is still built upon the foundation of "catching up with" or "surpassing" others, won't that peace be like a sandcastle built on the beach, beautiful to look at, but unable to withstand the next incoming tide?

Perhaps true freedom lies not in winning this competition. But in whether we have the courage to question the competition itself.

## **Part Two: The Source of Value: Why Do I Care So Much?**

### **Chapter Three: The Inner Climate: The "Innate Wind" and "Acquired Rain" of Energy**

To understand why we are so sensitive to "comparison," why the poison of envy is so harmful, and the ladder of admiration so enticing, we must shift our exploratory gaze from external behaviors to our inner world.

Our inner world is like a vast wilderness, with its own climate system. Sometimes the sky is clear and the breeze is gentle; even if the body is tired, the heart is full of strength. Other times, however, it's overcast and the cold wind howls; even if nothing is done, there's an inexplicable sense of fatigue and depletion. This inner feeling, I prefer to call "psychological energy," or using a more Eastern term—"inner vital energy (yuanqi)."

I know a very interesting Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) friend who once took my pulse and said that my physical constitution was "innately deficient," requiring careful conditioning through acquired diet and lifestyle to supplement the "innate deficiency" with "acquired qi." It was then that I suddenly realized that a person's vitality is determined by these two forces combined.

This theory gave me great inspiration. If it's true for the body, is it also true for the mind? Can our "inner vital energy" also be divided into "innate wind" and "acquired rain"?

Each of us comes into this world psychologically like a blank slate. Our original family, especially parents or important caregivers, are the first to draw on this blank slate. Their unintentional words, casual glances, and ways of handling problems are all like gusts of wind, shaping the initial topography of our inner world. This is what I call the "innate wind"—it does not refer to biological heredity, but rather to those environmental factors in our early personality formation that we had no choice over.

I have two friends whose stories serve as the most vivid footnotes to this model.

Let's call him Gu Yuan. Gu Yuan is one of the most psychologically energetic people I know. It's not that he hasn't experienced failure; on the contrary, his entrepreneurial journey has been full of twists and turns. But he possesses an astonishing "resilience"; no matter how hard he falls, he always quickly gets up, dusts himself off, and laughs, saying, "It's fine, just consider it tuition." He carries an almost childlike optimism and confidence, as if the words "I can't" don't exist in his world.

I once curiously asked him about the source of this courage. He told me a story from his childhood. In elementary school, he once messed up a school science competition; the small car he built with blocks and a motor fell apart in front of everyone. He cried all the way home, expecting a scolding. To his surprise, his father didn't utter a single word of blame; instead, he held him in his arms and said, "Oh, the way this car fell apart is even cooler than when it was running! Like a Transformer exploding! Quick, tell Dad, how did you originally intend for it to transform?"

Gu Yuan said that from that moment on, he vaguely understood one thing: making mistakes and failing would not make him lose his family's love. His worth was not attached to any single success or failure.

This warm and firm "innate wind" from his childhood nurtured him as he grew up. It shaped his inner climate, ensuring that even when he encountered storms as an adult, he always had a warm haven within. His "inner vital energy" was abundant; he dared to try, dared to make mistakes, because deep down, a firm voice told him: "No matter what, you are valuable."

My other friend, Wen Jing, presented a completely different picture. Wen Jing was the kind of girl who was exceptionally kind, incredibly hardworking, and remarkably "sensible." At work, she always completed her tasks perfectly, yet you rarely saw a sense of ease about her. She was like a perpetually taut string, extraordinarily sensitive to others' evaluations. A casual remark from her boss like, "Can this proposal be done faster?" could make her ponder all day, repeatedly scrutinizing whether she had done something insufficiently well.

Wen Jing's childhood was spent in an atmosphere of "comparison." Her parents didn't not love her, but they were accustomed to educating her with a kind of "motivation." "Look at Jiaming next door, he got first place again this time, you should learn from him." "Your cousin is so good at playing the piano, why are you so untalented?" These words, like gusts of cold "innate wind," blew into her young heart.

The message carried by this wind was: you are not good enough as you are; you need to be better than others to prove your worth and to earn your parents' approval and love.

Consequently, she grew into someone who constantly needed to seek external validation to "energize" herself. Others' praise was her fleeting warm sun; others' criticism was a blizzard in her heart. Her "inner vital energy" was deficient, like a deflating ball that needed external input to barely maintain its full shape. She lived a very tiring life because her joys and sorrows were not in her own hands.

The stories of Gu Yuan and Wen Jing clearly show us that "self-worth," a seemingly abstract psychological term, is actually the core regulatory system of our inner climate. A person with high self-worth is like having a powerful internal thermostat; external temperature changes can hardly cause a fundamental impact on them. In contrast, a person with low self-worth is like a house with drafts on all sides; even a slight disturbance outside will stir up a cold current within their heart.

Understanding this allows us to truly grasp why, when faced with "comparison," some can turn it into motivation, while others are dragged into an abyss. This is because it's not just a matter of mindset or choice, but a direct reflection of whether our inner "vital energy" is sufficient. A person who is already struggling to feed themselves will hardly have the mental energy to ponder more advanced cooking techniques.

So, for those like Wen Jing, who did not receive enough nourishment from the "innate wind," are they destined to live their entire lives in this sense of lack?

Of course not. Because in addition to the "innate wind," on the wilderness of our lives, there is also the "acquired rain" that we can choose for ourselves as adults. Although this rain cannot change the direction of the wind, it can, in a gentle and lasting way, slowly change the texture of the soil.

### **Chapter Four: Climbing a Tree for Fish: The Demands Behind Sacrifice**

Before discussing how to nourish our inner land with "acquired rain," we must first identify a method of irrigation that appears to be "sweet dew" but is actually "poison."

This method is "sacrifice."

In our cultural context, "sacrifice" is a highly glorified word. It is tightly bound with greatness, selflessness, and dedication, shining with a moral halo. However, if we peel back this glittering facade to examine the frequent "self-sacrifice" dramas played out in intimate relationships, we often find that behind this tragic play lies a cold, calculating ledger of gains and losses.

I once encountered a client whose story reminded me of the protagonist in the popular TV series "The First Half of My Life" from years ago. Let's call her Sophie. Sophie graduated from a prestigious university and once had a glamorous job at a foreign company. But when they got married, her husband lovingly told her, "You don't have to work so hard, I'll support you."

It was this alluring promise that led Sophie to set aside her career and pride, choosing to become a full-time housewife. She poured all her time and energy into this family. She kept the house impeccably organized, cared for her children meticulously, remembered every family member's birthday, and carefully prepared gifts. She gave up her social circle, drifting apart from former colleagues and friends. In her own eyes and everyone's, she had made enormous sacrifices for this family.

However, she did not find the happiness she had expected.

As her husband's career flourished, they found less and less common ground. He would discuss industry trends she didn't understand at cocktail parties, while all she could share were her children's report cards and the color of the new curtains. She became increasingly uneasy, like a constantly alert radar, catching any suspicious signal from her husband: late-night engagements, unfamiliar perfume scents, vague phone calls.

Her sacrifice did not bring more love and security; instead, it bred endless grievances and resentment. During a heated argument, she cried out to her husband, "I gave up everything for you, for this family! How can you be so at peace with yourself?"

She thought this tearful accusation would elicit guilt and pity from her husband. But what she received was his tired and indifferent reply: "But... I never forced you to do any of that."

In that moment, Sophie's world collapsed. She couldn't understand why her seemingly "selfless" devotion had yielded such a result.

Sophie's predicament reveals a cruel truth: in intimate relationships, sacrifice is often a case of climbing a tree to catch fish. You think you're chopping firewood, but you're actually climbing a tree that will never bear fruit.

The American family therapy master Virginia Satir once proposed a famous "Iceberg Theory." She likened a person's inner self to an iceberg floating on the sea, where what we can see is only the small tip above the water, called "behavior." Below the surface, however, lies the massive body of the iceberg—our feelings, perceptions, expectations, longings, and the deepest "Self."

If we use the Iceberg Theory to analyze Sophie's "sacrifice" behavior, what would we see?

Above the surface, her behavior was "giving up her career for the family." This is a seemingly noble and dedicated act.

But diving beneath the surface, we see her enormous, unmet expectations and desires. She longed to exchange this act of "sacrifice" for her husband's eternal love, absolute loyalty, and the highest recognition of her value in the relationship. Giving up her career wasn't just abandoning a job; it was putting her most precious "chips" into the gambling game of marriage. She bet her youth and future, hoping to win back a lifetime of "indebtedness" from him and the emotional attachment that would follow.

When she cried out, "I gave up everything for you," the unspoken subtext was actually: "Therefore, you must love me with your whole being, you must feel guilty towards me, and you must never leave me."

Is this not a form of demand? An emotional blackmail carried out under the guise of "for your own good." This connects seamlessly with the issue of "low self-worth" we discussed earlier.

It is precisely because a person deep down does not believe they are inherently worthy of love that they attempt to use "sacrifice"—a grand, almost impossible-to-refuse moral stance—to earn love's chips for themselves. She dares not directly voice her needs—"I need your attention," "I'm afraid of being abandoned by you," "I wish you loved me as much as I love you." Because she fears rejection, fears her needs might seem trivial to the other person. Thus, she chooses a more circuitous and destructive path: she first makes herself a "saint," a "martyr," and then stands on the moral high ground, making it impossible for the other person to leave due to "indebtedness."

What a sorrowful case of climbing a tree for fish this is. It ultimately fails to gain love, only suffocation. The sacrificer becomes unrecognizable in daily repression, while the sacrificed, under heavy moral shackles, only wishes to escape.

In stark contrast to this "sacrificial" selfishness is a "healthy selfishness."

I know a couple whose way of interacting seems somewhat "unconventional" to many. The husband is an introverted technical expert, passionate about coding and models; the wife is outgoing and cheerful, an entrepreneur with strong career ambitions. In their home, it's "the man manages the inside, the woman manages the outside." The husband takes on more childcare and household responsibilities, while the wife leads the charge outside.

Their choices drew considerable criticism from neighbors. Many people, especially older family members, accused the wife of being "too selfish," saying she "lacks any spirit of sacrifice and doesn't act like a good mother."

At a gathering once, I half-jokingly asked her how she viewed these evaluations. She smiled and very candidly told me, "If I truly gave up my career to meet others' expectations and became a full-time housewife, that would be the most selfish thing I could do for this family."

I asked her to explain. She said, "My passion and sense of worth are built upon my career. If I forced myself to give it up, I wouldn't become a gentle and virtuous wife; I would only become a 'resentful woman' full of grievances. I would feel that the whole world owed me, and I would unconsciously vent that resentment on my husband and children. At that point, our home would never know peace. Now, I do what I love, my heart is full and happy, and I bring this positive energy home. My husband also supports me because he knows that a happy wife is far more important than a 'correct' wife. We simply chose the way that best suits both of us, allowing each of us to feel comfortable and fulfilled."

Her words showed me the profound wisdom behind "healthy selfishness." It's not the selfishness of disregarding others' well-being, but an attitude of complete responsibility for one's own life and emotional state. It's built on the foundation of "I must first make myself a person with inner abundance." Because only when one is full can they flow out true, unconditional love and care.

A bird that plucks out its own feathers cannot bring warmth to another bird. A person who empties themselves cannot truly nourish others.

Therefore, on the path to inner peace, we must be wary of those seemingly noble "sacrifice" traps. It is often a disguise for low self-worth, a dead end leading to mutual depletion. True nourishment stems from equal, mutually respectful giving. It comes from daring to face and honestly express our needs, rather than blackmailing others for satisfaction by playing the "victim."

Only when we learn to take responsibility for our own state of being, and stop "climbing a tree for fish" through "sacrifice," can we clear a clean, healthy soil for the arrival of "acquired rain."

### **Chapter Five: The Energy Account: Where Does Your "Exhaustion" Come From?**

In our inner world, there exists an invisible "psychological energy account." The balance of this account directly determines our state of life—whether we are full of spirit and vitality, or listless and utterly drained.

For those with insufficient "innate qi" and low self-worth, the operation of this account is particularly fragile. They are like a company heavily reliant on external investment to stay afloat, with weak "self-generating" capacity. The profit and loss of the account depend entirely on whether external "funds" (i.e., others' affirmation, praise, admiration, and recognition) can arrive on time.

Regarding this, I heard a deeply memorable story from a senior mentor. This story perfectly illustrates this pattern of relying on external nourishment and its inherent significant risks.

This mentor, let's call him Teacher Li, has worked in the field of psychology training for many years, known for his highly engaging teaching style. He loved the stage, enjoying the process of imparting knowledge and energy to students and receiving their enthusiastic responses. A four-day, three-night course, with over thirty hours of standing, was commonplace for him. However, most of the time, when a class ended with thunderous applause and students surrounded him to share their insights and gratitude, he not only felt no fatigue but was instead energized and vibrant, as if freshly recharged.

He said that feeling was like standing at the center of an energy vortex. He gave out knowledge and mental effort, but from the sparkling eyes of the students, their frequent nods, and the sincere hugs and thanks after the course, he received a tenfold, even hundredfold, return of energy. His "energy account" gained a huge profit from this transaction.

However, one teaching experience in Malaysia nearly led him to "bankruptcy."

He was invited to teach a course on organizational psychology to a group of Chinese entrepreneurs there. As usual, he prepared engaging case studies and interactive sessions, and began his presentation with full dedication. However, he soon discovered that the atmosphere among the audience was completely different from what he was accustomed to.

The students were all very serious, each listening attentively and taking notes. But their faces showed little expression. Unlike students in China, they wouldn't erupt in enthusiastic applause at exciting points, wouldn't actively raise their hands during interactive segments, and certainly wouldn't eagerly gather around him to chat during breaks. The entire classroom was quiet, reserved, and orderly, like a solemn academic presentation.

Teacher Li initially thought his course content wasn't engaging enough, so he worked even harder to liven up the atmosphere, telling his favorite jokes and sharing his most touching stories. But the audience's reaction remained polite and distantly calm.

The four-day, three-night course concluded in this state of almost "no feedback." When Teacher Li spoke his last sentence, polite, rather than enthusiastic, applause sounded from the audience. The students quietly packed their belongings and silently left, not a single person staying behind to chat with him as usual.

At that moment, Teacher Li said he felt an unprecedented "exhaustion." It wasn't physical fatigue, but a feeling of being completely hollowed out, from the inside out. He stayed alone in the empty lecture hall, feeling like a robot with depleted batteries, unable to lift even a finger. After returning to the hotel, he even fell gravely ill.

Why did an equal amount of effort yield such vastly different results?

Later, after talking with local friends, Teacher Li gradually understood that this was not because his course was unpopular, but due to cultural differences. Malaysian Chinese culture, deeply influenced by traditional Chinese Confucian thought, is generally more introverted and reserved, unaccustomed to expressing strong emotions and praise in public. The students' attentiveness was their highest form of expressing recognition.

But for Teacher Li at that time, his internal "energy account" was heavily reliant on "enthusiastic feedback"—an external, immediate "injection of funds." His mind had already scripted a familiar "play" for this course: I give -> students give enthusiastic responses -> I gain energy and satisfaction.

However, in Malaysia, the "actors" in the audience did not follow his script. When his most crucial energy source was cut off, his account was left with only continuous "expenditures" and no "income." After four days, this account was naturally "emptied."

This story profoundly reveals that the true source of that "exhaustion" might not be the depletion of energy, but rather the "unmet expectation" within, which, like a sudden black hole, instantly sucked away all our vitality. We feel "emptied out" not always because others have consumed us, but more often because our own insatiable craving for external validation consumes us.

The lower a person's self-worth, the stronger their dependence on this external nourishment. Their emotions, their energy levels, and their self-perception are all built upon such a fragile lifeline. When this lifeline is carelessly held in the hands of others, how can they achieve true, stable happiness?

Recognizing this brings us to a critical junction on the path to healing. We must answer a core question: How can we transform from a "trading company" reliant on external investment into a "solid enterprise" with strong internal "blood-generating" capabilities? How can we learn to sow, water, and fertilize within our own inner world, ultimately welcoming an "acquired rain" that can nourish the roots of our lives?

## **Part Three: Inner Alchemy: From Passive Reaction to Active Creation**

### **Chapter Six: The First Remedy: From the Quagmire of Envy to the Ladder of Admiration**

When we clearly understand the operating mode of our inner "energy account" and desire to break free from the fragile dependence on external evaluations, a profound journey of inner transformation officially begins. This transformation, like a long alchemical experiment, aims to transmute the heavy, impure "lead" within us (such as inferiority, envy, a sense of lack) into sparkling, stable "gold" (i.e., solid inner worth and peace).

However, no great transformation can happen overnight. For someone stuck in a quagmire, we cannot expect them to instantly fly into the clouds. What we must do first is hand them a strong enough rope, so they can first climb out of the deepest despair.

This rope is the crucial shift we discussed earlier, from "envy" to "admiration."

We must clearly recognize that this step is not the ultimate goal of this alchemy. It is more like a potent "emergency remedy," a "psychological tourniquet" that can save a life in a crisis.

Imagine, when the emotion of envy wraps around your heart like a venomous snake, your entire world turns gray. Your reason is paralyzed by the poison, and all your energy is focused on the existence that stings your eyes. You unconsciously magnify the other person's strengths and your own weaknesses, your heart filled with injustice, resentment, and powerlessness. In this state, any grand talk about "inner peace" or "transcending comparison" seems pale and ineffective, even like a mockery.

At this point, the most important and only feasible thing is to act first, to break this destructive negative cycle.

Force yourself to abruptly redirect that hostility, which is almost consuming you and directed at others, into constructive thinking directed at yourself. This process might feel very awkward, even painful, at first, requiring you to summon all your willpower.

You can try asking yourself this question: "If I could possess the one thing about the other person that makes me most envious, how would my life be different? What is the smallest, most insignificant step I can take right now to achieve that state?"

This question is like a beam of strong light, instantly illuminating the dark psychological chamber overshadowed by envy. It forcefully switches your role from a helpless "victim" to an "actor" who can make a difference.

For example, when you feel envious because a friend posts about their perfect physique on social media, that "smallest, most insignificant step" might not be to immediately get an expensive gym membership, but simply to do ten minutes of stretching at home following a video, or take a brisk walk around a nearby park.

When you feel resentment because a colleague got a project you coveted, that "smallest, most insignificant step" might not be to complain to your boss, but to spend an extra half-hour after finishing your own work to learn a new skill related to that project.

These actions themselves may not immediately change your situation in the short term. But their significance far outweighs the practical effects of the actions themselves. They are like a sacred ritual, sending an incredibly important signal to your subconscious:

"I am not powerless. I can choose not to wallow in destructive emotions. I can take action for the life I want."

Each time you make such a conscious transformation from "envy" to "admiration" and then to "action," you are giving your psychological muscles a small workout. You are severing the neural pathway leading to self-destruction while simultaneously forging a new path toward self-construction.

Therefore, we must fully affirm the value of this step. It is our "psychological self-preservation." It allows us to climb out of the most dangerous quagmire of internal friction onto solid ground. It gives us a chance to breathe and regain a sense of control.

However, we must also soberly recognize its limitations.

If we stop here, content with becoming a more diligent "chaser," then our lives will still be a competition set by others. We would merely transform from a passive participant to an active one. Our joys and sorrows would still be tied to our distance from others.

This remedy can heal our most urgent wounds, but it cannot eradicate our inner "susceptibility." It can help us climb out of the mud, but it cannot prevent us from falling back in next time.

To achieve true, lasting inner peace, we need a more thorough inner alchemy. We need to learn not just to chase the sunlight when we see it on others, but to create an unsetting sun within our own inner world.

### **Chapter Seven: Mental Photosynthesis: Creating Sunlight in Your Own World**

How do we create an unsetting sun within our own inner world? This may sound like a poetic fantasy, but behind it lies a set of real, feasible, and profound psychological mechanisms.

I call it—"Mental Photosynthesis."

Let's imagine a plant. A plant growing in a dark valley, constantly lacking sunlight. Its branches and leaves are weak, its color dull, because it desperately craves the nourishment of the sun. When a ray of sunlight occasionally pierces through the clouds and the canopy, shining on its leaves, it immediately feels warmth and vitality, and frantically stretches itself to embrace this fleeting blessing.

This is like the state of those of us with insufficient "inner vital energy" when we occasionally receive external affirmation and praise. We feel joy, we feel nourished, and we even exhaust ourselves chasing the next ray of sunlight. Teacher Li's "exhaustion" in Malaysia was precisely because the sunlight he expected never appeared.

But a healthy plant doesn't just passively "enjoy" sunlight. Internally, it undergoes an incredibly miraculous transformation: it uses the sun's energy to synthesize carbon dioxide from the air and water absorbed from its roots into energy-rich sugars that can be stored and utilized by itself.

This process is photosynthesis.

These synthesized "sugars" are the fundamental reason this plant can still breathe, grow, and maintain life activity during long, sunless nights. It transforms transient, external energy into lasting, internal vitality.

Our mental growth follows precisely the same logic.

External praise, affirmation, appreciation, and goodwill are the "sunlight" in our mental world. They are very important, especially when our inner self is still fragile. But we cannot merely dwell on the superficial feeling of "being warmly illuminated by the sun"; we must learn to activate our inner "photosynthesis" mechanism to transform this external, fleeting energy into our own internal, stably storable "psychological nourishment"—that is, a solid, unwavering sense of self-worth.

How exactly does this inner alchemy work? It's not some abstruse magical technique, but rather a series of small psychological activities that require our conscious execution.

**Step One: Consciously receive, rather than unconsciously push away.**

For many people with low self-worth, when "sunlight" (praise) shines upon them, their first reaction is often to "push it away."

"You did great today!"
"Oh, no, no, I just got lucky."

"That outfit looks really good on you!"
"Oh, really? It was cheap, just something I threw on."

This habitual "self-deprecating modesty" may seem polite, but in reality, it rejects nourishment for the soul. It's like a plant that instinctively folds its leaves when sunlight appears. It sends a message to the subconscious: "I don't deserve this affirmation," "This praise isn't real."

Therefore, the first action of "Mental Photosynthesis" is to consciously resist this habit. When a kind affirmation comes your way, try not to immediately refute or belittle yourself. Let that warmth linger in your heart for a few seconds. You can look into the other person's eyes, smile, and say, "Thank you, I'm happy to hear you say that."

This simple act is extraordinarily significant. It's equivalent to you generously unfurling your leaves, ready to embrace the sun's baptism.

**Step Two: Extracting "Value" from "Facts."**

Simply receiving sunlight is not enough; the key to photosynthesis lies in "transformation." After a positive external feedback occurs, we need to perform a small "value extraction" exercise on ourselves afterward.

For example, a colleague thanks you, saying: "Thank you for helping me solve that tricky software problem last time, it really helped me a lot!"

After receiving this gratitude, you can, in the quiet of the night, take out your journal, or simply in your mind, ask yourself:

"What quality or ability of mine does this gratitude prove?"

There could be many answers:
"I possess the ability to solve technical problems."
"I am a helpful person."
"I am reliable in my colleagues' eyes."
"My experience is valuable."

Do you see? You transform an isolated, external "event" (a colleague's gratitude), through extraction, into a series of internal "value descriptions" about "who I am." This is like a plant converting light energy into chemical energy that can be absorbed by its cells.

**Step Three: Build your "Inner Value Storage Room."**

Some of the sugars produced by photosynthesis are immediately consumed, while others are stored for future needs. The same applies to our psychological nourishment.

I strongly recommend you prepare a dedicated notebook or a private document, which I call a "Sparkling Moments Log." Each time you complete a successful "value extraction," write down those positive "value descriptions" about yourself.

"I am a persistent person because I stuck to morning runs for a month."
"I have good aesthetic taste because my outfit received compliments from friends."
"My communication skills have improved because I successfully mediated a minor team conflict."

This logbook is your "Inner Value Storage Room." It's not a brag book to show off achievements, but a solid, fact-based "evidence library" you build for yourself.

What is its purpose?

When, one day in the future, you encounter setbacks again, fall into self-doubt; when that ancient "comparison program" whispers in your ear again, telling you "you're not good enough"; when the "sunlight" from outside is temporarily absent, making you feel cold and lonely...

You can then open this storage room.

What you see will no longer be vague self-comfort, but concrete pieces of evidence, genuinely recorded by your own hand, about "who you are." You will see that you are not as bad as you imagined, that you have overcome so many difficulties, and that you possess so many wonderful, proven qualities.

This process is like a plant on a cold winter night beginning to use the sugars it stored in summer to power itself. You are using the inner nourishment you've accumulated in the past to withstand the current psychological winter.

By performing this "Mental Photosynthesis" day after day, you will discover that wonderful changes are occurring. Your dependence on external evaluations will gradually decrease. Because you are no longer a hungry beggar foraging everywhere; you have become a farmer with your own granary. Others' praise is no longer life-saving sustenance for you, but more like a delicious dessert—it's great if you have it; but if not, you can still live well.

An unsetting sun is rising within you. It may not be as dazzling as the midday sun, but its light is constant, warm, and entirely, completely, your own.

### **Chapter Eight: The Ultimate Choice: For Growth, Not for Victory**

As we gradually build our own "Inner Value Storage Room" through the deliberate practice of "Mental Photosynthesis," a silent yet profound transfer of power is taking place within our inner world.

The fragile "I" that once dominated, constantly needing external validation, is slowly receding to a secondary position. A more stable, resilient, and self-nourishing "I" begins to take control of our lives.

It is from this new starting point that we finally arrive at the exciting, truly liberating—**Ultimate Choice**.

At this moment, we can once again, calmly and clearly, look back at that ancient "comparison program" embedded deep within our genes.

In the past, when we became aware of it running, our hearts would be filled with anxiety and resistance. We viewed it as a troublesome "bug," a "demon" we were eager to get rid of. We tried every method to suppress it, ignore it, or transform it with the ladder of "admiration." But all these efforts were, in essence, a "response to battle." We remained in opposition to it, fighting a never-ending, exhausting war with it.

But now, the situation is different.

When we no longer feel a threat to our survival due to internal scarcity, when we know our value no longer depends on defeating our peers, we can finally, for the first time, re-examine this ancient companion that has accompanied humanity for millions of years, with a peaceful, even tender gaze.

We can say to it:

"Hello, old friend. I know you're there again, reminding me to run faster, to become stronger. I can feel that deep anxiety of yours, stemming from ancient times. For millions of years, it was this anxiety that protected my ancestors, allowing them to survive the brutal natural selection and ultimately pass the torch of life into my hands. For this, I sincerely thank you."

"However, I also want to ask you to look at the era we live in. We no longer inhabit that perilous wilderness. My survival no longer depends on whether I possess a sharper stone spear than my neighbor. Your historical mission has been gloriously accomplished. Thank you for your guardianship; now, you can rest in peace."

This inner dialogue is more than just a beautiful self-comfort. It represents a profound reconciliation with our own nature. We no longer see the "comparison program" as an enemy, but rather as an "old soldier" who has faithfully served but whose methods are no longer suited to the new era. We respect its achievements, understand its motives, and then, gently and firmly, reclaim its excessive "military authority" within our mental world.

This reconciliation grants us an unprecedented, truly meaningful freedom.

We can finally, from the bottom of our hearts, understand the full meaning of that sentence:

"**The reason you choose to be better today is not out of a need for survival, not because you have to compare yourself to others, but because you choose to make yourself better.**"

Let us savor the immense power contained within this "choice."

When a person "has to" do something, their state is tense, anxious, and full of pressure. They are like a slave pursued by debt, whose sole purpose of action is to "escape" some negative outcome (being eliminated, left behind, despised). Their eyes are constantly fixed on the pursuers behind them, with no time to appreciate the scenery along the way.

However, when a person "chooses" to do something, their state is relaxed, engaged, and full of passion. They are like a free explorer, whose purpose of action is to "experience" a positive process (growth, creation, exploring life's possibilities). Their eyes are always fixed on the horizon ahead, full of curiosity and anticipation for the unknown.

These two states might be performing exactly the same actions, yet their intrinsic psychological experiences are worlds apart.

Let me conclude this chapter with a mountaineering analogy.

In the past, we climbed mountains for "victory." Our backpacks were filled with heavy anxiety and self-doubt. Our sole goal was to plant the flag that read "I am better than others" at the summit. We were out of breath, ignoring the flowers at our feet and missing the clouds beside us. Each time we surpassed someone, it brought fleeting pleasure; each time we were surpassed, we fell into immense pain. We were prisoners of this climbing race.

Now, however, we climb mountains for "growth." Our backpacks are filled with water, food, and a journal to record the scenery. Our goal is to experience the climb itself—to feel the soreness in our muscles, the rhythm of our breathing, and the joy of an ever-expanding view as we ascend. We might journey with companions, encouraging each other; we might genuinely cheer for others who reach the summit first, because their success proves to us that this path is traversable.

We no longer care about the illusory flag on the mountaintop, because we know that the true treasure is the stronger, more expansive, and freer self we become during the climb.

We are still climbing upwards, but we are no longer slaves to the competition. We have become the true masters of this journey of life.

This inner shift, from the pressure of "having to win" to "choosing to grow," is the ultimate key that can unlock all the shackles of our hearts. It won't make the world stop its clamor, but it can allow you, amidst the noise, to hear that quiet yet powerful echo within your heart, unmoved by any external factors.

## **Part Four: Transcending the Game: A Gentle Reconciliation with the World**

### **Chapter Nine: Shaking Hands with the Inner "Clippy Assistant"**

When we have weathered countless storms and finally reached the free shore of "choosing to grow," an interesting question arises: will that ancient "comparison program" simply vanish? Can we, through practice, completely and permanently "uninstall" it from our mental system?

The answer might bring a touch of disappointment to those of us who strive for perfection: no, we cannot.

As long as we remain human, as long as the imprint of millions of years of evolution still flows in our genes, the code of that program will forever be etched there. In certain unguarded moments, it will still automatically run, almost as a reflex.

You might feel a gentle pang in your heart when you scroll past a photo of a friend's company ringing the stock market bell late at night; you might experience an indescribable flicker of disappointment when you hear someone else's child won a major award; you might even feel a brief moment of self-doubt when reading an article more brilliant than one you wrote yourself.

Yes, even if we have become the "masters" of our own lives, that loyal, somewhat stubborn "old soldier" will still instinctively jump out from the corner when it hears a "war" horn, attempting to "defend" us once again.

So, how should we face this "never-disappearing it"? Are we destined to spend the rest of our lives in this endless "whack-a-mole" game?

No. Because at this moment, we possess a higher wisdom. We no longer need to fight against it; instead, we can learn a more relaxed, more elegant way of coexistence.

I want to use an analogy that might reveal my age to describe this new relationship.

I wonder if you remember, many years ago, in Microsoft Office software, there was a classic character—a paperclip made of a few lines, with two big eyes (Clippy). We called it the "Clippy Assistant."

Its original design intention was to "intelligently" help users. But its actual performance often made people laugh and cry. When you were deep in writing, it would suddenly pop out from the corner of the screen, blinking its innocent big eyes, saying, "Hey! It looks like you're writing a letter, do you need help?" When you just wanted to draw a table, it would eagerly poke its head out: "Oh! You seem to be having trouble, would you like to try the template I prepared for you?"

Most of the time, it not only failed to help but also interrupted your train of thought, causing a touch of irritation. In our early days, we might have angrily tried various methods to close it, uninstall it, or even curse its designers in our minds. We viewed it as a "bug" that had to be eliminated.

But as time went on, when we became proficient with the software and no longer needed any "help," our relationship with this Clippy Assistant quietly changed.

When it clumsily popped out again with untimely suggestions, we no longer got angry. We might even find it a bit cute, a bit comical. We might, in our hearts, with a touch of fondness and indulgence, say to it:

"Oh, there you are again, old pal."

Then, we would skillfully click the "close" button and continue with our work. We would no longer expend any effort on its appearance, nor would we try to eradicate it from the system. We simply saw it, acknowledged its existence, and then calmly dismissed it.

Our ultimate relationship with that inner "comparison program" is precisely this.

It is that ever-present "Clippy Assistant" in our mental system. Its sole purpose is to "help" us. It's just that its "help logic," stemming from ancient times, is long outdated.

When our inner self is still fragile and eager to prove ourselves, we interpret its every "reminder" as a judgment against us, thus feeling immense pressure and pain. We desperately want it to shut up.

But when our inner self is sufficiently abundant and no longer needs to rely on defeating others to define itself, we gain the ability to "shake hands and make peace" with it.

When that voice of "Hey, look at others, then look at yourself" rings in our minds again, we no longer need to immediately activate defense mechanisms to analyze it, transform it, or lecture it with grand principles like "I choose to grow." We can simply, in our hearts, smile at it as we would the silly Clippy Assistant, and say:

"Got it, thanks for the reminder. But I'm fine now and don't need your help for the moment."

This process, I call "humorous disidentification."

"Humorous," because we no longer treat this thought seriously, as if facing a formidable enemy. We see the clumsy but well-intentioned motive behind it, and even find it a bit pitiable, a bit comical.

"Disidentification," on the other hand, is even more crucial. We clearly recognize that the clamoring voice is not "me." It is merely one of the many thoughts that arise and pass away in "my" mind. It's like the sound of rain outside the window, or clouds floating in the sky; we can be aware of it, but we don't have to equate ourselves with it.

This lighthearted, almost playful mindset is the highest form of inner freedom. It means we no longer need to "do something" to achieve peace; we simply "are" peaceful. We no longer try to control thoughts, but rather exist serenely amidst the arising and fading of all thoughts.

This is a profound "presence." It is the true perfection achieved after fully embracing the imperfections of our own nature.

### **Chapter Ten: When the Cup Overflows: From Self-Sufficiency to Warming the World**

As we traverse this long and profound inner journey—from understanding genetic programming to healing childhood scarcity, from initiating mental photosynthesis to finally shaking hands with inner "noise"—our lives will manifest a new, touching landscape.

I want to use a simple analogy to depict this ultimate transformation.

Initially, our inner self was like an empty cup. Because it was empty, we were filled with a craving for the external world. We longed for others to pour us a little water—that water being praise, recognition, attention, love. We spent our days holding our cups, carefully following behind others, overjoyed to receive a few drops of sweet dew, and despairing in prolonged dryness. Our joys and sorrows were all tied to others' kettles.

Later, we embarked on a journey of self-growth. We learned "mental photosynthesis," no longer relying solely on others' giving. We began to seek out our own water sources, learning how to dig, how to filter, how to transform bitter saltwater into drinkable sweet springs. This was an arduous process of "active endeavor," where we put in immense effort, finally filling our own cups little by little. We felt proud and secure in this full achievement. We had our own water, no longer needing to depend on others' moods.

This is a remarkable achievement, the fulfillment of "cultivating one's own moral character."

However, the story does not end here.

When our inner exploration is deep enough, when we reconcile with our own nature and gain that lightness of "living life playfully," the well within us is completely opened. It connects to a deeper, broader source of life. Clear springs begin to gush forth ceaselessly.

Our cup is not only full but begins to naturally, unconsciously, overflow outwards.

This overflowing water is the purest, most selfless kindness, empathy, and care.

It is no longer a "good deed" we need to deliberately perform. We give, not to fill our "positive feedback log" with others' gratitude; we care, not to play the role of a "kind person."

It is simply because we ourselves are so full that we must overflow. Like a cup filled with water, if tilted slightly, the clear water will naturally spill out to nourish the surrounding land. This giving is spontaneous, natural, and without the thought of "I am giving."

This is the natural transition from "cultivating one's own moral character" to "benefiting the world."

I recall an old professor I knew; he was well past retirement age, yet still shining brightly in his field. He never pursued fame or fortune, and many younger scholars had long "surpassed" him academically. But he possessed a peace and warmth that made one feel as if bathed in spring breeze.

He was never stingy with praising young people. When he saw an excellent paper, he would genuinely email the author, telling them where he had been inspired. His praise held no hint of a senior's "condescension" towards a junior, but rather felt like a fellow traveler who had discovered beautiful scenery along the way and couldn't help but share the joy with you.

He was also never afraid to reveal his "ignorance." In discussion meetings, he would earnestly ask young people about new technologies he didn't understand, like a student. His questions were full of pure curiosity, without any pretense or unease.

Being with him, you wouldn't feel any pressure. You wouldn't feel like you were being "compared" or "judged." You would only feel completely seen, completely accepted. He was like a constant "luminous body," not a dazzling, strong light that you had to look up to, but a warm, gentle hearth fire. Just by being near him, you could feel the coldness in your heart melting away.

He was the person whose "cup overflowed." His very presence was a form of nourishment.

This, perhaps, is the most moving destination of our inner alchemy journey. We initially embarked on this quest merely to resolve our own pain, to transmute the "lead" within ourselves into "gold." But when we truly forged that inner gold, we discovered that its greatest value was not in making ourselves rich, but in the gentle light it emitted, which could illuminate those around us.

We grow from a child longing to be loved into an adult with a full heart and the capacity to love.

We evolve from a participant struggling painfully in comparison into a warm observer who can applaud all participants.

We transform from an individual striving to be better for ourselves, ultimately becoming a humble contributor who, by being good themselves, makes the world a little better.

This, perhaps, is the most profound meaning of "choosing to be better."

## **Conclusion: Your Choice, Your Freedom**

Our journey, by now, is near its end.

We began with the monologue of a friend feeling lost in the dead of night, then retraced our steps, diving into the ancient wilderness deep within our genes, seeing that lonely and vigilant ancestor running for survival. We understood the "comparison" imprint left in our bloodline, that profound fear of "being abandoned."

Next, we examined the two forces that this imprint generated within us—the poison of envy and the ladder of admiration. We saw how low self-worth consistently led us to play the tragic card of "sacrifice" in the game of life, yet we were climbing a tree for fish, failing to gain true love and peace.

Then, we embarked on the inner alchemy. We learned the method of "mental photosynthesis," transforming external sunlight into internal, never-ending energy. We finally stood at that crossroads of destiny, making the groundbreaking "ultimate choice"—no longer fighting for victory, but climbing for growth itself.

Ultimately, we learned to shake hands and make peace with that never-disappearing, somewhat comical "Clippy Assistant" within us, and were pleasantly surprised to find that when our cup finally overflowed, our greatest joy became nourishing the land around us.

This journey, it seems, is a transformation from a "gladiator" driven by genes, to a "climber" who actively chooses, and then to a "gardener" who gently reconciles with the world.

Now, it is time to return this power to you.

Perhaps, when you close this book and return to real life, you will still hear the voice of "comparison" whispering in your ear. But you already know that it is merely an ancient echo, no longer your destiny. The "power of choice" in your hands is the true king in your inner world.

From now on, every step you take, regardless of its size or speed, as long as it is your own choice, will be full of meaning. Every small beauty you create will become an eternally shining star in your inner universe.

Go forth and choose. Choose to be better, not to surpass anyone, but simply not to let down this magnificent, one-time journey called "life."
