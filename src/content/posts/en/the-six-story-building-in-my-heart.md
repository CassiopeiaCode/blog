## Introduction: Lost in Our Own Building

Yuanzhou and I have known each other for many years.

In our shared circle of friends, he has always been like a "top student." Graduating from a prestigious university, he quickly joined a well-reputed company, holding a decent position with a considerable income. What's more commendable is that he hasn't become jaded or materialistic like many who achieve success; he maintains an intellectual and clear-sighted scrutiny of the world. His bookshelf is one of the few I've seen that's genuinely used for reading, not just decoration, with a wide range of topics from philosophy and history to cognitive science.

Logically, such a person should be confident and composed, in control of his own life. Yet, I always sensed an indescribable "stuttering" in him. It was like a top-tier computer, with all the most advanced software installed, but it would occasionally drop frames, lag, or even blue screen without warning.

That summer night, we sat in his study. Outside, the city's neon lights never faded; inside, it was unusually quiet. He had just finished a week of exhausting work and was slumped in the sofa, looking somewhat weary. He got up, picked a thick notebook from his desk, and handed it to me.

"Look," he said with a wry smile, "this is my new schedule."

I took it. It was densely filled with various goals, pathways to achievement, and self-motivating phrases, written in three different colors. Everything from quarterly career plans to what time he should wake up tomorrow morning and how long he should do cardio was clearly marked. In the blank spaces on the pages, there were also quotes from famous people, such as "Your hesitation is surrendering your life."

"Theoretically, I should be making progress, right?" He rubbed his temples. "I've read books on habit formation, I know about building micro-habits and positive feedback; I've learned time management techniques, I understand how to prioritize and manage urgency; I even signed up for a mindfulness meditation class, and I clumsily practice breath observation for ten minutes every day. But every morning when I wake up, it feels like the computer has forcefully rebooted. All the resolutions and insights from yesterday vanish, and I'm back to my familiar, procrastinating, anxious self."

He paused, his voice dropping, as if confiding a secret.

"What frightens me most is that I feel like a stranger lives inside my body. My rational self knows I should turn off the computer and go to the gym, that I should calm down and write that long-overdue report. But that 'stranger,' like a brute force, firmly presses me into the chair, making my fingers unconsciously open one irrelevant webpage after another. I don't even know him, I don't know what he wants, yet I'm completely controlled by him."

He looked out the window. The city's clamor seemed to rush in at that moment, only to be silently blocked by the glass.

"You know," he finally said, his voice as soft as a sigh, "I'm like someone living in a house I designed and built brick by brick myself, but I'm lost in it."

---

Yuanzhou was right.

His predicament, to varying degrees, isn't it what many of us are also experiencing? We live in an era where knowledge is unprecedentedly accessible. We have countless tools and methodologies to analyze and improve ourselves, yet at the same time, we feel an unprecedented disconnect from our true selves.

Each of us has such a building in our heart. It's not made of steel and concrete, but of our thoughts, emotions, memories, and desires. From the outside, it might have various styles – some are magnificent castles, some are simple wooden houses, some are futuristic glass structures. But once you step inside, you'll find the internal structure surprisingly similar: it's a six-story building.

The first floor is a spacious and bright hall, connecting to the outside world, where we receive guests and handle daily chores.

The second floor is a never-ending stage, where we play various roles every day, enacting scenes of life's comedies and tragedies.

The third floor is a quiet study and toolroom, storing all the knowledge and skills we've acquired.

The fourth floor is a mysterious archives, containing all the building's rules of conduct and hidden regulations that even we ourselves might not know.

The fifth floor is a solemn gallery, with portraits of "who I am" hanging on the walls, defining our existence.

The top floor, the sixth, is a rooftop garden where we can gaze at the stars, feeling connected to distant things.

The problem is that most of us are "specialized" residents. We're too accustomed to staying on the first and second floors, busy dealing with the wind and rain outside the window and performances on stage, forgetting that there are rooms upstairs, and even forgetting that we own the entire building. We don't know what rules are written in the fourth-floor archives, yet we let them remote control our lives; we've never carefully examined the portraits on the fifth floor, yet we let them define who we are.

So, like Yuanzhou, even though we are the owners of this building, we live like tenants who can't find their way.

---

Therefore, this article isn't meant to give you another new schedule or a new "three-step method." It's more like a tour guide, an architectural blueprint of this six-story building.

I invite you to temporarily set aside the urgency of "solving problems" and the self-judgment of "not being good enough." With the curiosity of a tourist, or the patience of an architect, let's open every door, climb every staircase, and reacquaint ourselves with our own house.

The purpose of this tour is not to tear down and rebuild this building – that would be a pity, as it carries all of our life stories; every scratch holds time. Our goal is to find and reclaim the key to each floor, which belongs to us.

When we can freely drink tea by the window on the first floor, read in the study on the third floor, and watch the stars from the rooftop on the sixth floor, we will become the true owners of this building. That "stranger" living in our body will finally be gently seen and reconciled with.

So, are you ready?

Our journey begins on the most familiar first-floor hall.

## Chapter 1: First Floor | Environment: The World We Respond To

Let's push open the door and step into the first floor of this small building.

This is the "reception area" and "living room" of the entire structure, where our inner world meets the external world. What do you see? Perhaps there's a huge floor-to-ceiling window, outside of which is the city you currently live in, your office, or the bright screen in front of you. Sunlight or rain falls through the window onto the floor, casting different shadows and bringing different temperatures.

The furnishings in the hall represent our material conditions, social status, and various resources. Some people have soft, comfortable luxury sofas, while others only have a simple wooden stool. The bookshelves along the wall might be filled with books, or they might be empty. These are our "factory settings" when our story begins.

There are always guests coming and going in the hall; they are the relationships in our lives. Some guests are warmly welcomed, their arrival filling the hall with laughter; others are uninvited, their presence potentially making us feel awkward and uncomfortable. Parents, partners, friends, colleagues, superiors... they move through the hall, making various sounds, leaving various traces.

On the wall, there must be a large clock and a never-ending calendar. They represent the dimension of time we inhabit—the deadlines that urge us, the memorable dates, and even more, the irreversible, always-forward flow of life.

Beyond that, the hall is also filled with a never-ceasing background noise. It comes from the social culture, public opinion, and collective consciousness we are embedded in. It might be news playing on TV, trending topics scrolling on social media, neighborhood gossip, or industry trends... They are like an endlessly looping soundtrack, and we, being in it for so long, might even forget its existence.

---

This is the first floor, with which we are constantly interacting. In psychological terms, it's called the "**environment**" layer. It encompasses all external conditions we are in and need to respond to: **time** (when), **place** (where), **people** (who we are with), and **things** (what is around us). It forms the objective backdrop of all our life experiences and is the answer to the question, "Where am I?"

It is so real, vast, and concrete that we often fall into a misconception—thinking that this first-floor hall is the entirety of our world.

So, naturally, we directly equate our internal feelings with our external environment.

"The weather is bad today, so I'm in a terrible mood."
"My original family was so bad, that's why I am the way I am now."
"If it weren't for this job taking up all my time, I would have pursued my dreams long ago."
"This society is too 'involutionary'; no matter how hard I try, it's useless."

This mindset of attributing problems to the environment has immense appeal. It offers the simplest, fastest explanation, temporarily freeing us from the guilt and self-doubt of "am I not good enough?" Blaming an external environment we cannot control is like finding a culpable "other" in court, which can temporarily protect our fragile self-esteem. It's a psychological "energy-saving mode" that quickly gives us a false but easy sense of control.

But the cost of this temptation is high. When we fully surrender our power to the environment, we also surrender the possibility of change. Our life script transforms from being actively written to being passively received. We shift from being potential "creators" to helpless "reactors," merely sitting in the center of the hall, passively waiting for the weather outside the window, the words of guests, and the background noise to dictate our mood and behavior for the day.

I have a friend named Xiaowen, a very talented interior designer. But for several years after graduation, she could hardly hold down any job for long, like a migratory bird always on the move.

At her first company, she often complained to me about her boss's outdated aesthetics, unable to tolerate those "glitzy" design requirements; at the second, she felt the problem lay with her colleagues, believing their thinking was rigid and completely incapable of effective teamwork; moving to a third startup, she was initially very satisfied, but soon began to complain that the company's processes were too chaotic and project management was a mess. Each time she left, she did so with a sense of relief, firmly believing that "the next one will be better," that the next "hall" would surely have more ideal furnishings and guests.

But after experiencing a fourth, almost identical cycle, she fell into deep confusion. That time we met at a coffee shop, she stirred her latte, uncharacteristically silent for a long time.

"It's strange," she finally said, "I've changed four completely different 'rooms,' but why does the ultimate feeling remain largely the same? Always from initial excitement, to mid-term endurance, to final disappointed departure."

During that long conversation, she suddenly realized a neglected detail. She said that although the "scenery" of each company was different, in all four "halls," she unconsciously chose the same spot—the corner closest to the door, with the dimmest light, ready to slip away at any moment. She always habitually looked for and examined the room's shortcomings instead of its advantages. Her interpersonal pattern was the same: she would first silently label new colleagues as "potentially difficult to work with" in her mind, and then seek evidence.

"I think I understand," she said thoughtfully, "I've been busy changing places, but I've never thought that maybe the real problem isn't the room itself, but my posture in the room."

Xiaowen's story is like a mirror, clearly reflecting many of us. It tells us that the environment is important; it indeed forms the foundation of our lives. But often, what truly traps us is not the objectively existing environment, but our "relationship" with the environment—how we view it, how we interpret it, and what posture we choose to adopt within it.

---

The environment is objective, but our relationship with the environment is subjective. This statement might sound abstract, but behind it are two very important mechanisms of our brain's operation.

The first is the "interpretation system." Our brain is not a cold camera objectively recording all information. It's more like an experienced "director" who edits and interprets the scene before us based on a "script" already written deep within (i.e., our past experiences, memories, and beliefs). So, the same rain is a romantic poem in the eyes of lovers, but an annoying obstacle in the heart of a traveler rushing to the airport. The rain is still the rain, but our interpretation system assigns completely different meanings to it.

The second is "selective attention." Our attention is like a freely moving spotlight. In the information-saturated hall of the first floor, wherever our spotlight shines, that scene will be infinitely magnified, becoming our perceived "entire reality." We can choose to continuously shine it on the spiderwebs in the corner and the stains on the floor, thereby feeling annoyed and dissatisfied; we can also choose to direct it towards the orchid on the windowsill, striving towards the sun and quietly blooming, and feel a sense of peace and joy from it.

We cannot always choose which hall we enter, just as we cannot choose our original family, and it is difficult to change jobs at will. But we always, always have the right to choose where to shine the spotlight and which window to look out of. This right to choose is the most precious initiative we can grasp on this seemingly passive first level.

Now, if you are willing, you can do a small exercise with me.

Please pause for a minute and look around your "first-floor hall"—the room you are currently in, your work environment, your recent interpersonal relationships.

I know your "spotlight" might be habitually shining on the "noise" that bothers you and the "furnishings" that dissatisfy you. Now, deliberately, like moving a real camera lens, slowly shift it away. Look for three beautiful things that have always been there but might have been overlooked by you.

Perhaps the warmth of a cup of hot water perfectly warms your palm.
Perhaps a melody from your headphones perfectly soothes your nerves.
Perhaps a casual friendly greeting from a colleague.
Perhaps just the shape of a cloud outside the window reminds you of a distant past event.

Find them, and let your attention linger on them for ten seconds. Feel the genuine sensation they bring you.

This simple exercise is the first step from "passive reaction" to "active choice." It's like declaring: although I am in this hall, I am the master who decides which scenery to see.

---

The first-floor hall is the foundation of our existence, the place where we shake hands with the world. Acknowledging its influence is seeing reality; but completely surrendering to it is giving up power. True wisdom lies in firmly grasping the right to subjective choice while fully accepting the objective environment.

However, a new problem emerges: why do we habitually shine the spotlight on negative places? Who decides this "choice" of which window we stand at to view the scenery? Merely relying on willpower to "think positively" often ends in failure.

This seems to imply that the main light switch and curtain pull for the first-floor hall are most likely controlled from upstairs.

Now, it's time to visit the second floor. A never-ending drama is unfolding there, and we are both actors and audience.

## Chapter 2: Second Floor | Behavior: Everything We Do and Think

Going up a staircase, perhaps carpeted or shining like a mirror, we arrive at the second floor.

The atmosphere here is completely different from the first floor. If the first floor is a relatively static "living room," then the second floor is a bustling, never-ending "theater." The stage lights are always on, and the only actor is ourselves. Here we perform our entire lives—every word we speak, every decision we make, even every thought that flashes through our minds.

The stage set changes continuously with the environment of the first floor. Sometimes it's in an office cubicle, sometimes at a family dinner table, sometimes amidst the clamor of a friends' gathering. In different settings, we play different roles: an employee, a partner, a friend, a child.

Our lines are what we say to others, and more importantly—our never-ending internal monologue to ourselves. Our actions are all our concrete behaviors: a diligent overtime work session, an angry quarrel, a kind act of help, an endless procrastination. Our phones, coffee, books, documents in hand are the most important props in this play.

In the audience, sit those we care about or don't, their gazes, applause, or boos constantly influencing our performance.

---

Here, then, is the "behavior" layer of our inner world. It encompasses all **concrete actions** we take (running, writing), **words we speak** (arguing, praising), and **specific thought processes** in our minds (planning, worrying). It is the most direct, observable output of our inner world. Almost all the stories of our lives, the impressions we leave on the world, are determined by the drama unfolding on this floor.

For this very reason, when we want to change ourselves, our focus is most easily directed here. We believe that as long as we can manage the actor on this stage, making him strictly follow the "script" we've written, our lives will improve.

We've all written exciting scripts for ourselves, haven't we?

The script is titled "Disciplined Morning," with a plot of waking up promptly at six, morning run, reading, and a healthy breakfast.
The script is titled "Patient Communication," with a plot of remaining calm, listening to the other person, and gently expressing oneself when disagreeing with family.
The script is titled "Focused Work," with a plot of single-mindedly handling the most important tasks during work hours, refusing all distracting temptations.

The scripts are written clearly, explicitly, and full of hope. We confidently tell ourselves: "Tomorrow, I will perform this way."

But strangely, when the stage lights come on the next day, the actor on stage—which is ourselves—often seems to have picked up the wrong script. He improvises a completely opposite play: one called "The Struggle to Sleep Five More Minutes," one called "Uncontrollable Angry Roars," one called "Endless Web Browsing and Self-Loathing."

---

This sense of loss of control is so familiar, yet so frustrating. We usually attribute it to "lack of willpower." And so, we begin a war with ourselves. Our rational self, like a strict director, yells at the "disobedient" actor from below the stage: "Pull yourself together! Stick to the script! You're not allowed to be lazy!"

It's like a long tug-of-war. One end of the rope is our rationality, planning, and beautiful hopes for the future. The other end of the rope is the actor's deeply ingrained habits, inexplicable impulses, and momentary desires. We pull with all our might, pulling the rope a little closer to our side, but as soon as we relax, or even just because we're too tired from work today or in a bad mood, the rope gets yanked back, sometimes even further than before.

Worse still, after every failed performance, we initiate a harsh "internal criticism session." We chastise the actor: "I'm really terrible," "I'm just a person with no willpower," "I'll never change." This self-reproach, far from improving the next performance, instead adds immense psychological burden to the actor. When he takes the stage next time, he will be more timid, less confident in his ability to perform well, and thus more likely to give up.

I have a friend named Linkai, who is the most frequent actor in the "quitting smoking" solo play among everyone I know. He tried every method I've ever heard of: nicotine patches, e-cigarettes, watching various shocking documentaries, and even setting an enlarged photo of his own teeth as his phone wallpaper.

Every attempt to quit smoking was like a grand premiere. He would clear all cigarettes and lighters from his home, announce it to everyone on social media, accepting supervision and encouragement. He would chew nicotine gum, painfully enduring the first few days. During that time, he exuded a kind of "sacred irritability."

But the plot would always, at some unsuspecting moment, be completely reversed by a tiny prop. Perhaps a cigarette offered by his boss after overtime; perhaps at a friends' gathering, everyone habitually started smoking while tipsy; or perhaps just watching an old movie where the protagonist's act of lighting a cigarette suddenly struck him.

He said that at that moment, the internal tug-of-war between "health" and "pleasure" was instantly decided. That "stranger" craving nicotine took over his body in just one second. When he finished that "relapse" cigarette, immense pleasure and equally immense shame would drown him. Then, he would silently delete that "quit smoking" post from his social media and return to his familiar routine, until the next whim struck him to re-enact this play he already knew by heart.

Linkai's story is a classic "behavioral layer" dilemma. He was constantly fighting the act of "smoking" itself, but never truly stopped to ask: What does this behavior actually bring me?

In psychology, there's a very important concept called "the intention behind behavior," or "secondary gain." It refers to the idea that any "bad" behavior we want to quit is so stubborn precisely because, in some ways, it fulfills a deeper, unseen inner need, perhaps clumsily or harmfully.

For Linkai, the act of "smoking" might have met many of his needs. When exhausted from overtime, it provided a "legitimate" excuse to pause work and be alone for five minutes; at friend gatherings, it was a social tool to blend in and start conversations; when anxious, it was the fastest, most effective tranquilizer.

These needs—the desire for a breather, the need for social connection, the longing for peace—are inherently legitimate. It's just that "smoking" was the most convenient "solution" he found to satisfy these needs throughout his long life.

---

So, we can perhaps draw a conclusion that will relieve many people: the disobedient actor on stage is not lazy or depraved; he is simply responding to unseen, deeper desires in the only way he knows how. He is not a bad actor; he just received a contradictory script.

Forcibly changing behavior is like crudely ordering an actor to improvise without changing the script. Of course, he will mess up because he doesn't know why he's performing.

This means that all our efforts at the "behavioral level," if they remain solely on behavior itself, are likely to be superficial and not address the root cause. Because behavior is just the outcome of the story, just the tip of the iceberg floating above the water. It is merely a symptom, not the root of the problem.

True change requires us to temporarily shift our gaze away from this bustling second-floor stage and stop wrestling with that exhausted actor. We need to find the invisible "director" and read the never-before-seen "script."

Where are they, then?

Let's go upstairs to find out.

## Chapter 3: Third Floor | Capability: How We Do It

Leaving the noisy theater on the second floor, we continue up the stairs, arriving at a relatively quiet space—the third floor.

This place is like the "study" and "workshop" of our inner building. The air might be filled with the scent of old books and wood. On the bookshelves lining the walls, all the knowledge and theories we've learned are neatly arranged; on the workbench, there are various tools and skills that we rely on for our livelihoods. Here, we answer the question of "how to do."

If "behavior" on the second floor refers to our specific actions, then "capability" on the third floor is our systematic talent, formed by internalizing and integrating these actions, making them reusable. On the second-floor stage, we might have performed one "behavior" very well, for example, giving an excellent speech beyond our usual ability. But this doesn't mean we possess the "ability to speak." Only when we grasp the inner principles of speaking, and can consistently and stably deliver high-quality speeches, does this "behavior" truly settle, moving from the second-floor stage into the third-floor workshop, becoming a handy tool in our toolbox.

---

In psychology, the "**capability**" layer refers to the **systematic, repeatable skills, strategies, and mental models** that we have mastered and can use. Its fundamental difference from a single behavior lies in its **stability and transferability**. Possessing a capability means we can not only accomplish something in one scenario but also apply it flexibly and by analogy in different scenarios.

The acquisition of any complex capability almost always follows a similar path. This path is usually divided into four stages, like the four steps to adding a new tool to the third-floor workshop.

**The first stage is "unconscious incompetence."** In this stage, we not only cannot do something, but we are not even aware that we cannot, or that the thing exists. Like a primitive person who has never seen a computer, he cannot type on a keyboard and is completely unaware of the existence of "typing" as a skill. For a new capability, this is our "chaotic" initial state.

**The second stage is "conscious incompetence."** This is the true starting point of our learning. We begin to encounter this new skill, become aware of its existence, and clearly see the huge gap between ourselves and "being able to do it." This stage is often painful and clumsy. Think about our first experience learning to drive: our eyes need to watch the rearview mirror, our ears need to listen to the instructor's commands, our left foot needs to control the clutch, our right hand needs to shift gears; our mind is in chaos, and our hands and feet are completely disobedient. We clearly know we "can't," and we need to invest a lot of cognitive resources just to barely complete the most basic actions. This is the stage where it's easiest to give up, yet it's also the stage where we make the fastest progress.

**The third stage is "conscious competence."** After a lot of practice, we finally "can do it." We can recall the steps "start the ignition, engage gear, release handbrake" in our minds and consciously drive the car smoothly onto the road. We can complete tasks, but the whole process still requires us to maintain a high degree of focus, which consumes a lot of our energy. Like a programmer who has just learned to code, he needs to constantly consult resources and carefully type each line of code to ensure the program runs without errors. We can do it, but we are not yet proficient enough.

**The fourth stage is "unconscious competence."** This is the true sign of a capability being "internalized." When our mastery of a skill reaches a state of perfection, it no longer requires us to consciously think and control it. It seems to be engraved in our muscle memory and neural circuits, becoming an almost instinctive, automatic response. Like an experienced old driver, he can drive while listening to music, chatting, or even thinking, with all driving operations automatically handled by his subconscious. This capability has transformed from a "tool" that needs constant polishing into an "organ" that extends from our body.

---

I have a friend who, a few years ago, was known in our circle as a "DIY idiot." If a lightbulb at home went out, he'd rather stumble around in the dark for two days than call the property management to fix it. He'd get utterly confused by the instructions for IKEA furniture. In his own words: "I'm just not cut out for this."

Later, he bought an old house that needed extensive renovation. Perhaps it was due to a limited budget, or perhaps something suddenly ignited his fighting spirit, but he decided to do it himself. I still remember his initial awkwardness. It was a weekend, and I went to see him. He was assembling a bookshelf. Various screws and wooden boards were scattered on the floor, and he was sweating profusely, looking at the instructions with a mixture of anger and confusion on his face. That day, it took us an entire afternoon to barely get that shaky bookshelf upright.

This was his "conscious incompetence" stage. He knew he couldn't do it, and every step was filled with frustration.

But he didn't give up. He started watching a lot of instructional videos online, learning from the very basics of how to use an electric drill. He bought a pile of tool books, researched wall painting techniques, and learned how to connect pipes. When I visited his house again, I could see various failed wood pieces and materials piled on the balcony. His hands, too, began to show various scars and calluses.

Slowly, changes occurred. He sent me photos; he had successfully laid the kitchen floor; after some more time, he built a beautiful brick bar counter himself. On the phone, he could clearly articulate the characteristics of different paints and discuss the pros and cons of various wood panels. He had entered the "conscious competence" stage. He could do it, and he was doing it better and better, but every step still required planning and thought.

Another year passed, and when I visited his house again, I could barely recognize it. The entire house was meticulously organized by him, filled with various clever designs. That day, he was making a small wooden horse for his daughter. I saw him wearing safety goggles, skillfully operating the cutting machine, planing, sanding, painting; all his movements were fluid, like an experienced craftsman. I no longer saw the young man who was at a loss with the instructions. This skill, which once terrified him, had now become a part of him, a kind of "unconscious competence."

This story vividly illustrates how capabilities are built. It tells us that every tool in our third-floor study is acquired this way, from nothing to existence, from clumsiness to mastery, through repeated tedious practice and application.

---

However, a new, deeper question also arises.

Many of us are not actually lacking in ability. In today's information-rich world, our "study" on the third floor might be filled with all sorts of "advanced tools" and "perfect blueprints" for solving problems. We know how to eat healthy, how to communicate effectively, how to manage emotions. We possess the knowledge of these "capabilities," and some of us have even successfully used them at certain times.

But why, more often than not, do we prefer to let these advanced tools gather dust on the third-floor shelf, and instead rush to the second-floor stage to perform in the most primitive, clumsy, and even self-loathing ways?

Why do we "know" so much, yet still live our lives poorly?

What exactly is that huge gap between "knowing" and "doing"?

This seems to suggest that even if we have a room full of tools, whether or not to use them, and which tools are permitted, this "permission" is controlled by some authority on a higher floor.

Now, it's time to go to the fourth floor. It might be a bit dim there, storing all the true secrets of this building.

## Chapter 4: Fourth Floor | Beliefs & Values: Why We Choose This Way

The staircase leading to the fourth floor might be narrow and dim, perhaps even dusty. We rarely come here.

Pushing open the door, you might feel the air is somewhat heavy. This place is unlike any floor downstairs. It's not a living room, not a theater, nor a study. It's more like a vast and intricate "power distribution room" and "archives." The walls are covered with dense wiring, switches, and meters, with countless indicator lights flickering in the dimness. In the center of the room stands rows of tall filing cabinets, containing all the "regulations" and "operating laws" of this building since its construction.

This is the fourth layer of our inner world. It determines the flow of energy throughout the entire building and defines the boundaries of all behaviors. What is stored here are our beliefs and values.

---

In psychology, "**beliefs**" are our subjective judgments about "what the world is." They are not facts, but "facts" that we choose to believe. For example, "the world is dangerous," "effort pays off," "I'm not good with words"... these are all beliefs. They act like "filters" in our brain, sifting, coloring, and processing all incoming information between us and the real world.

And "**values**" are our intrinsic standards for what we consider "more important." They are about priorities. For instance, between "safety" and "freedom," which do you value more? Between "achievement" and "family," which comes first? Our values are like an internal "navigation system" that guides us in making choices when we face life's crossroads.

Beliefs and values together form the underlying operating system for our decisions and behaviors. They are like the most basic "if-then" statements in computer programs, running automatically in the background, filtering the information we see, triggering our emotional responses, and ultimately leading to specific behaviors, even when we are not aware of it.

For example, a person who deeply believes "the world is dangerous" will automatically direct their attention's "spotlight" to potential threats in the environment; in interpersonal interactions, they will tend to be more suspicious and defensive; when faced with opportunities, they might choose to retreat due to fear of risk. The entire building's electrical system is laid out around "danger" as the core belief, and the operation of all floors is governed by "ensuring safety" as the highest directive.

These crucial "core codes" are mostly quietly written into us during our early lives, especially in childhood. They might come from parents' repeated warnings ("Don't easily trust strangers"), from a deeply personal experience (a hurtful betrayal), or from the subtle influences of our social culture. At the time, the formation of these beliefs was often to protect us, helping us adapt to that environment. But as we grow, the external world has long since changed dramatically, yet these deeply buried, outdated "regulations" on the fourth floor still faithfully operate, limiting our possibilities today.

What we often call "imprinted ideas" are stamped right here.

I once heard a story about an artist.

This artist, Julian, was extraordinarily talented, his paintings filled with astounding imagination and vitality. All teachers and peers who saw his work believed he had a brilliant future. But he had a strange pattern: he could easily win awards in small art exhibitions, but whenever faced with greater opportunities—such as a national art show or an invitation to sign with a famous gallery—he would always "mess it up" in various inexplicable ways at the last minute.

Sometimes he "accidentally" missed the submission deadline; sometimes he inexplicably got heavily drunk the night before the most important meeting; and once, he even "lost" his portfolio that he had prepared for half a year.

Those around him felt sorry for him, believing he was just "unlucky." He himself fell into deep confusion and self-blame; his "behavior" on the second floor was self-sabotaging, and his "capabilities" on the third floor were completely unable to manifest. He tried various methods, creating stricter schedules, seeking supervision from friends, but all with little effect.

The turning point occurred during a very accidental hypnosis therapy session. In a state of deep relaxation, the therapist guided him back to those moments when he "messed up," to feel the emotions at that time. In that blurry space of consciousness, he touched a deep, long-ignored feeling—fear.

Delving further, a long-buried childhood scene surfaced before him. He was about seven or eight years old, and one of his paintings won an award at school. He excitedly ran home with the certificate, wanting to be praised by his father. His father, a stern and unsuccessful old-school painter, looked at his painting for a long time, but finally just said coldly, "A little cleverness, but don't be arrogant. People in our family don't have that 'fate.' The higher you climb, the harder you fall."

It was this casual remark, like a seed, that landed in his young heart. To "safely" survive in such a family environment, he unconsciously accepted and internalized this conclusion, and in the fourth-floor archives, with a childlike hand, he wrote down a core regulation for himself: "Success is dangerous; it will bring punishment and downfall. I don't deserve true success."

This deeply buried belief, in his later life, became an incredibly loyal "guardian." Whenever Julian approached true, significant success, this "guardian" would be activated, pulling down the entire building's "circuit breaker," creating all sorts of chaos and accidents to protect him from the imagined, destructive harm of "the higher you climb, the harder you fall."

When Julian, in the therapy room, tearfully "saw" all of this, he finally understood that the self who repeatedly "messed everything up" was not trying to destroy him but was protecting him in a clumsy way. His seemingly illogical self-sabotaging behaviors on the second floor all stemmed from this long-forgotten, fear-laden "rule" on the fourth floor.

---

This story powerfully demonstrates the immense power of beliefs. It tells us that if we do not visit the fourth-floor archives and examine the "core codes" we do not even know we possess, then all our "self-improvement" efforts on the lower floors may fail due to "insufficient power" or "system conflicts."

So, how do we begin this exploration of the fourth floor?

This is destined to be a journey requiring patience and courage. For we are about to touch upon the core structures that we have wrapped layer by layer to define our world. Directly "modifying" them often triggers strong internal resistance. Therefore, our first step is not to modify, or even to judge, but merely to—"see."

You can try, in a quiet moment, to ask yourself some questions:

*   What do I believe deep down about "money"? (Is it "scarce, dirty," or "abundant, neutral"?)
*   What do I believe deep down about "interpersonal relationships"? (Is it "troublesome, unreliable," or "nurturing, trustworthy"?)
*   What do I believe deep down about "myself"? (Is it "not good enough, flawed," or "worthy of love, valuable"?)

When you think about these themes, pay attention to the first unbidden thought that flashes into your mind. That thought is often the most prominent label on the fourth-floor archive cabinet.

You don't need to immediately refute it. You just need to be like a visiting librarian, holding a flashlight, quietly illuminating it, seeing its existence, and saying to yourself, "Oh, so my archives have such a rule."

This "seeing" itself is the beginning of change. It means you are starting to shift from being a "rule-follower" to a "rule-observer." When light shines into this dim room, we gain the first glimmer of possibility to choose anew.

## Chapter 5: Fifth Floor | Identity: Who We Are

Emerging from the archives on the fourth floor, where secret rules are stored, we continue upwards. The staircase leading to the fifth floor seems more solemn. You might notice that the materials here are different, perhaps heavy solid wood or smooth marble. The air also becomes exceptionally quiet, as if entering a sacred space.

This is the fifth floor, the "gallery" of our inner building.

There are no windows on the walls of the room, nor are they needed. Soft light streams down from the skylight, evenly illuminating the portraits hanging on the walls. These paintings all depict the same person—ourselves. Yet each one has a completely different posture, expression, and background.

One depicts a child, perhaps huddled in a corner, titled "An Unnecessary Person." Next to it, a diligent student, buried in a mountain of books and questions, titled "A Hardworking Good Student." Further along, an adult in business attire, with a subtle hint of fatigue on their face, titled "A Responsible Employee." And then there are "An Introvert," "A Strong Survivor," "A Failed Entrepreneur," "An Ordinary Person"...

These portraits collectively form the theme of this gallery. They answer the most fundamental question deep within us: "Who am I?"

---

This, then, is the fifth layer of our inner world, the "**identity**" layer. It is even more central and concise than the "beliefs and values" on the fourth floor. If beliefs and values are the "code" in our operating system, then identity is the "name and version number" of that operating system. It's not what we have, not what we can do, not even what we believe, but what we ultimately declare, "I am."

It is the ultimate aggregation of all our beliefs and values, unconsciously integrated by us over our long lives into a core story about "me."

This core story possesses the most powerful force in the entire building. In social psychology, there's a classic concept called "cognitive dissonance," which refers to the strong discomfort we feel when our actions conflict with our beliefs. What makes us most uncomfortable is when our actions conflict with that core "self-portrait" in our fifth-floor gallery.

To maintain internal harmony and consistency, we unconsciously act in ways consistent with our self-identity. This is like a massive gravitational field; it effortlessly pulls the operations of all floors below us—our beliefs, capabilities, behaviors, and even our interpretation of the environment—towards it, keeping them in alignment.

This is why identity-level changes bring more lasting and powerful effects than behavior-level changes.

Someone who defines themselves as "a person trying to quit smoking" has a whole story filled with struggle, resistance, and potential failure. Every time they smoke, it confirms the belief that "quitting smoking is hard," and every struggle consumes their limited willpower.

But if they can successfully change that core self-portrait in the fifth-floor gallery from "A Struggling Smoker" to "A Person Who Chooses a Healthy Lifestyle," then the energy flow of the entire building will change.

As "a healthy person," they will naturally focus on healthy eating (beliefs), learn about fitness (capabilities), choose to run instead of sitting on the sofa (behavior), and even prefer spending time with friends who also love exercise (environment). Quitting smoking is no longer a painful "war" but a natural, effortless "result" of a healthy lifestyle. They no longer need "willpower" to fight against anything, because the new identity has paved a completely new, easier path for them.

---

I have a friend who, through this method, completed an important transformation.

His name is Wenjie, and he was an extremely introverted person since childhood. In the era we grew up in, "introversion" was often considered a flaw. Teachers would say he "wasn't lively enough," and relatives would say he "wasn't generous." Over time, he accepted this label himself. In his fifth-floor gallery, the most central self-portrait was a somewhat somber one titled "An Inarticulate Introvert."

This identity, like an invisible curse, hung over him for many years. In social situations, he would feel immense pressure, because his "core code" told him: "I can't do it, I'm not cut out for this." So he would choose silence and avoidance (behavior), which further confirmed his belief that he was "not good with words." He missed many opportunities, whether for project collaboration at work or emotional connection in his personal life, all limited by this "identity."

He tried to change too. He went to the third-floor study and read many books on public speaking and communication skills, even memorizing some "standard phrases" for social occasions. But these "capabilities" were like external patches, incompatible with his internal operating system. In practice, he always seemed stiff, like a clumsy actor reciting lines. That sense of internal conflict exhausted him even more.

The turning point came after he encountered psychology. He began to realize that "introversion" itself is just a neutral temperamental trait, like being left-handed or right-handed, with no inherent good or bad. What truly trapped him was not the fact of being "introverted," but the negative "identity label" he had attached to it.

So, he began a long and quiet "gallery reorganization." He didn't force himself to become "extroverted," but instead tried to paint a brand new self-portrait. He asked himself: As an introverted person, what are my strengths?

He discovered that while he wasn't good at talking eloquently in crowds, he was excellent at one-on-one deep listening. He could keenly pick up on subtle emotional shifts in others.
He found that while he disliked small talk, he could engage in deep, insightful thought and expression on topics he was genuinely interested in.
He discovered that although he didn't have many friends, every friendship he did have was very genuine and lasting.

Gradually, a new portrait became clear in his mind. The title of this painting was — "A Deep Listener and Observer Who Thinks Profoundly."

When he started to act from this new identity, something wonderful happened. In meetings, he no longer forced himself to speak up, but chose to quietly listen to everyone's opinions, then, at the end, posed a well-thought-out, core question. At gatherings, he was no longer anxious about not fitting into the noise, but would find a friend who also preferred quiet, and engage in a higher quality, deep conversation.

He was still Wenjie; his inherent temperament hadn't changed. But the core portrait in his fifth-floor gallery had been completely refreshed. This new identity gave all his beliefs, capabilities, and behaviors on the floors below a new, self-consistent outlet. He no longer fought with himself, but truly reconciled with himself.

---

Wenjie's story tells us that we are not merely passive recipients of the faded old portraits in the fifth-floor gallery. We are, in fact, the "curators" of our own gallery.

We have the power to re-examine each painting. We can ask ourselves: Who painted this picture? Was it me, or did someone else paint it for me when I was a child? Does it depict who I am now, or who I used to be? Does it make me feel more empowered, or more powerless?

We have the right to decide which paintings to hang in the most central position of the gallery and which to move to the corner storage room. We can even, like Wenjie, pick up a paintbrush and paint a brand new self-portrait that better aligns with our life's aspirations.

This may be the most difficult, yet most exciting, task in the entire building. Because changing even one stroke here means redefining the entire building.

When you start to ponder the question "Who am I?" and try to give new answers, you are already standing in the center of the fifth-floor gallery, paintbrush in hand, ready to paint the most important work of your life.

## Chapter 6: Sixth Floor | Spirituality: Our Connection to Something Greater

Walking through the quiet gallery on the fifth floor, we come to a perhaps narrow spiral staircase leading higher. Pushing open the heavy door at its end, a rush of expansive wind greets us, and the view suddenly opens up.

We have arrived at the sixth floor. This is not an enclosed room, but an open "rooftop garden."

Standing here, we can overlook everything downstairs: the guests coming and going on the first floor, the drama on the second-floor stage, the lights in the third-floor study, the depths of the fourth-floor archives, the solemnity of the fifth-floor gallery. Everything is within sight. But more importantly, when we look up, we see a boundless sky. Whether it's the clouds drifting by during the day or the countless stars at night, they are directly connected to us.

This is the highest level of our inner building. It allows us to transcend the building itself and ponder an ultimate question: "Why does this building exist here?"

---

This, then, is the sixth layer of our inner world, commonly referred to as the "**spirituality**" layer.

The word "spirituality" is often associated with religion or mysticism, making it feel somewhat distant and impractical. However, in the context of our small building, we can demystify it and give it a more universal, solid definition.

**"Spirituality" is a sense of connection between oneself and a greater system that transcends the self.**

This "greater system" can take many forms. For a scientist, it might be the yearning to explore the truth of the universe; for an artist, it might be the pursuit of creating beauty; for an educator, it might be the mission to enlighten future generations; for a community member, it might be a sense of belonging to the collective well-being. It can even be our deep connection with nature, culture, history, or some ideal we cherish.

It answers the most fundamental questions deep within us: "Why am I here?" "What does my life serve?" "Beyond satisfying my personal needs, what is the longer-term meaning of all this?"

This sense of connection provides a "coordinate system" for our lives that transcends personal joys and sorrows. It's like an invisible anchor, connecting our small building, floating on the sea of time, to a wider, more enduring harbor. When a person is anchored at the spiritual level, when they find their own "starry sky," all their struggles and efforts on the floors below are given a new perspective and meaning.

The first-floor environment may still be noisy; the second-floor behaviors may still be clumsy and repetitive; the third-floor capabilities may still need refinement; the fourth-floor beliefs may still have conflicts; the fifth-floor identity may still be explored. However, when one ascends to the sixth floor and sees the starry sky that guides them, all these struggles are no longer annoying "problems" but meaningful "processes" for reaching that direction.

Striving is no longer merely about proving oneself to others (identity), nor is it solely about following certain rules (beliefs), but rather about enabling our building to better receive signals from that starry sky, to better serve that grander connection.

I once heard a senior tell the story of his father.

His father was a respected middle school physics teacher who taught his whole life in a small county town. In that era of material scarcity, he supported his entire family frugally with his meager salary. The senior said that in his childhood memories, his father was always busy and serious. He would prepare lessons until late at night, his "behavior" on the second floor was almost entirely focused on work; his "capabilities" on the third floor—his knowledge of physics—were his most valuable asset; his "beliefs" on the fourth floor—that knowledge changes destiny; his "identity" on the fifth floor—was a "strict teacher" and "responsible father."

After retirement, his father's life suddenly became empty. Away from the classroom and students, he seemed to have lost his most important coordinate. He became taciturn, spending his days watching TV, watering plants, and occasionally losing his temper over trivial household matters. All the systems on the lower floors of his building fell into chaos because they had lost their core "object of service."

His family worried about him and tried everything to make him "happy." They took him traveling, bought him various nutritional supplements, but with little effect. He remained like a plant deprived of sunlight, slowly wilting.

The change happened by a very accidental opportunity. There were a few children in the community whose parents were both working, and they had no one to look after them after school, often wandering outside. The father, seeing this, felt a pang of compassion and invited these children to his home, offering them free tutoring.

At first, there were just one or two, but later, as word spread, more and more children came. The father simply converted his living room into a small "community reading room." He brought out his treasured physics and chemistry teaching models again, told the children stories about the universe, and led them in interesting science experiments.

The senior said that during that period, he watched his father, like a withered tree, regain vitality. His face once again held a smile, and his eyes regained their sparkle. He no longer obsessed over life's trivialities or complained about his various physical ailments. His entire life seemed to be rekindled.

One day, the senior asked him, "Dad, what are you doing this for at your age?"

His father, who was wearing reading glasses and repairing an old globe, didn't even look up and said, "Nothing much, I just feel that these children need someone to light a lamp of curiosity about the world in their hearts. This is all I know how to do in my life."

At that moment, the senior suddenly understood. His father, after retiring, had been disconnected from the "greater system" he had served his whole life—"educating people." And this small community reading room allowed him to reconnect in a new way with the mission he cherished most, one that transcended himself.

He found his own "starry sky." This starry sky illuminated his later life, giving every floor in his inner building new meaning.

---

Ascending to the rooftop garden on the sixth floor does not necessarily require doing anything earth-shattering. It is more about an internal shift in perspective.

It is when we shift from "what I want to get" to "what I can contribute."
It is when we shift from focusing on "personal growth" to focusing on "my relationship with the world."
It is when we are willing to view our building as a node in a larger network, to shine, to connect, to serve.

This process may not immediately solve all our problems downstairs. But it will give us a broader container to hold those problems. It will give us a longer-term direction to navigate through the present fog.

Because when we find our own starry sky, we possess the most powerful internal drive.

## Chapter 7: Integration | Becoming the Wise Owner of the Building

Thus, we have completed our initial tour of this six-story building. From the objective environment on the first floor to the spiritual connection on the sixth floor, we have explored each level that constitutes our inner world.

But this building is not six isolated, static rooms. It is a dynamic, interconnected organic whole. A wise inhabitant must not only understand the function of each room but also know how to move freely between them and synergistically use their power.

This process we call "integration."

---

In psychology, "**integration**" means consciously perceiving and synergistically using the capabilities of all six levels. And the key to achieving integration lies in cultivating "**level fluidity**"—that is, when facing a specific problem, not fixating on a single level of thought, but being able to flexibly switch perspectives between levels, like a skilled photographer changing lenses with different focal lengths, to gain a more comprehensive and three-dimensional understanding of the problem and find the most powerful solutions.

Our previous tour was mostly by "stairs," climbing one floor at a time. This is a necessary, foundational process. But in this building, there's actually a quicker mode of transportation hidden—the "elevator."

The "elevator" represents those moments of "epiphany" in our lives. It might be triggered during a deep conversation, enlightened by a friend's remark; it might be during a trip, moved by the scenery before us; or it might be in a crisis, activating our inner potential. In those moments, we seem to instantly pass through all floors, seeing the full scope of the problem from a new, higher dimension, and old worries dissolve.

We cannot deliberately "press the elevator button," but we can create more favorable conditions for "epiphanies" by becoming more familiar with this building. And cultivating "level fluidity" is the most important "elevator riding guide" we can deliberately practice daily.

Let's use a pervasive dilemma many people experience—"the fear of public speaking"—to systematically demonstrate how a thinker with "level fluidity" views and solves this problem through these six "windows."

**When he stands at the window on the first floor (environment), he will ask:**
*   "What external environmental factors can I adjust to reduce the difficulty of this speech?"
*   He might choose a more familiar, secure venue; he will ensure all presentation equipment (PPT, microphone) is optimally set up; he might even engage in friendly conversations with a few audience members before the speech to create a more harmonious interpersonal atmosphere. He won't complain about the environment; he will actively optimize it.

**When he arrives at the window on the second floor (behavior), he will ask:**
*   "What specific behaviors do I need to execute for this speech?"
*   He will create a detailed practice plan, rehearsing the speech again and again in front of a mirror; he will record his voice, listening back to correct his speaking speed and intonation; he will practice deep breathing as a specific action to alleviate nervousness before going on stage. He won't just dwell on the vague wish of "I need to perform well"; he will break it down into actionable, specific behaviors.

**When he ascends to the window on the third floor (capability), he will ask:**
*   "What capabilities do I need to learn or improve to support this speech?"
*   He might discover he lacks clear logical structuring ability and thus studies the Pyramid Principle; he might feel he lacks vivid expression and thus watches videos of excellent speakers to learn their techniques; he might also learn some methods for commanding the stage and interacting with the audience. He won't say "I'm naturally not a speaker"; he will transform this vague problem into "What specific capabilities do I need to learn?"

**When he steps into the window on the fourth floor (beliefs), he will ask:**
*   "What beliefs do I hold deep down about 'public speaking'?"
*   He might become aware of some limiting beliefs, such as: "No one will be interested in what I say," "I'll be ridiculed if I make a mistake," "I must be perfectly flawless." He will consciously challenge these beliefs, look for counter-examples, and try to instill new, more empowering beliefs, such as: "My sharing is valuable," "The audience is friendly and forgiving," "Completion is more important than perfection."

**When he comes to the window on the fifth floor (identity), he will ask:**
*   "What 'identity' will I adopt for this speech?"
*   He has many identities to choose from: "a fearful person trying not to mess up," "an employee forced to complete a task." But he can also choose a more proactive, powerful identity for himself, such as: "an enthusiastic knowledge sharer," "a guide trying to inspire others." When he acts from the identity of a "sharer," his focus shifts from "what will others think of me" to "what value can I bring to the audience," and his internal fear will accordingly decrease.

**Finally, when he climbs to the window on the sixth floor (spirituality), he will ask:**
*   "What is the connection between this speech and my longer-term life purpose?"
*   He might consider that the content of this speech is in a professional field he deeply values, which could help newcomers in the industry; or that the success of this speech could secure him a more important project, and that project is related to his life ideal of serving society. When he connects this speech to a broader meaning, personal gains and losses and nervous emotions will be relegated to a less important position.

---

You see, the same "fear of public speaking," when we possess the ability to freely switch perspectives across the six floors, is no longer a rigid, unshakeable "problem," but a "project" that can be approached from multiple levels and has various solutions.

This is the power of "integration." It transforms us from a "victim" trapped by a problem into a "master" who has all the building's resources and can calmly face challenges.

To help you better practice this way of thinking in your life, here is a simple "self-diagnosis" framework. The next time you encounter a difficulty and feel "stuck," try taking out a pen and paper and, following these six levels, ask yourself:

*   **Environment Level:** Can I change or optimize my current environment?
*   **Behavior Level:** Can I take some new, specific, small actions?
*   **Capability Level:** Do I need to learn a new skill or knowledge?
*   **Belief Level:** What are my deepest beliefs about this matter? Is it limiting me or helping me?
*   **Identity Level:** In this situation, what "role" do I see myself as? Can I adopt a more empowering role?
*   **Spirituality Level:** What does achieving this mean for my longer-term life?

You don't need to find perfect answers at every level. Many times, you might find that the most crucial "bottleneck" is only on one or two floors. And once you gently leverage that most powerful point, the energy of the entire building might begin to flow again.

## Conclusion: Lighting Every Lamp in Our Home

Our journey has reached its end.

We started from the bustling hall on the first floor, connecting to the external world, and ascended. We visited the never-ending stage on the second floor, witnessing our daily behavioral dramas; we stepped into the tool-filled study on the third floor, examining the various capabilities we possess; we gathered courage to open the archives on the fourth floor, where our life's "core code" is stored, glimpsing the hidden beliefs that drive us; we climbed higher, entering the solemn gallery on the fifth floor, contemplating the self-portraits of "who I am" hanging on the walls; and we finally ascended to the rooftop garden on the sixth floor, where we could look up and search for the starry sky that guides our direction.

At the end of the tour, we also explored the silent yet crucial "foundation" supporting the entire building—our inner sense of security.

Now, it's time to return to the center of this building and re-examine it.

---

Before embarking on this journey, many of us, perhaps like my friend Yuanzhou, felt "lost" in the home we built with our own hands. We might have approached it with a "fixer" mindset, trying to find the "broken" part, repair or replace it, and then expect the entire building to operate perfectly and trouble-free ever after.

But after this tour, we might arrive at a new, more gentle conclusion.

This inner building of ours is not a machine; no part of it is "broken." The environment on the first floor is the soil of our existence; the behaviors on the second floor are our clumsy expressions; the capabilities on the third floor are proof of our efforts; the beliefs on the fourth floor were once our childhood armor; the identity on the fifth floor is our promise to ourselves; the starry sky on the sixth floor is our longing for the distant.

Every single level has its reason for existence and unique value. True growth is not about us despising the lower levels and only living on the higher ones, nor is it about tearing down this building, filled with the marks of life, and replacing it with a seemingly more polished "show home."

True growth is about transforming from a lost "tenant" or an anxious "fixer" into a free "owner" who understands and fully embraces their own unique building.

A wise owner understands every part of their home. They know which window on the first floor offers the most beautiful sunset; they know why similar dramas always unfold on the second-floor stage; they are familiar with every tool in the third-floor toolbox; they have the courage to step into the fourth-floor archives to dust off old regulations; they will often pause in the fifth-floor gallery, considering whether to paint a new self-portrait; and they will never forget, when feeling lost, to ascend to the sixth-floor rooftop to gaze at the ever-shining starry sky.

He no longer wars with his house. He knows that all the "imperfections" in this building—the cracks, the scratches, the slightly worn furniture—all carry his unique life story and deserve to be seen and respected.

The ultimate wisdom, perhaps, is to possess the ability to find a quiet corner within oneself at any time, holding the "master switch" of the entire building. Then, according to the present need, gently and consciously, light up each lamp on every floor of the home.

May you also become the serene person who lights the lamps in your own home.
