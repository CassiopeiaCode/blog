I must admit, when I decided to write about "empathy," my fingers hovered over the keyboard for a long time. To dissect this almost overused word in a long essay felt like an adventure destined to fail. Several times, I almost closed the document to write something lighter.

"Empathy"? Really, is there a more boring, more clichéd word?

It's like a jade stone, polished smooth by countless hands in self-improvement training camps, smooth, warm, politically correct, shimmering with a cheap glimmer of wisdom. It appears in every emotional blogger's video title, every company team-building icebreaker game, every time we try to comfort a friend but fail to find the right words, it's pulled out like a lifeline. We use it to label our kindness, to accuse others of coldness; it's almost become a new form of social currency.

We all "know" it's important. We say "have empathy" as readily as we say "drink more hot water," fluently and meaninglessly.

But do we truly "feel" it?

I don't know about you. But for me, the answer is, most of the time, I don't. What I feel is the breakage of connection, the futility of communication, two diametrically opposed yet ultimately converging, chilling wildernesses.

The first kind of wilderness, I call it the "Dry Well."

You've probably fallen into it too. You're carrying something very important to you: perhaps a messed-up interview, a relationship that withered away, or just a tiny thought that keeps you tossing and turning at night. You feel it's gone moldy inside you, and if you don't air it out, you'll rot completely. So you muster the greatest courage of your life, like a soldier going into battle for the first time, holding your bloody, pulsating heart, and walk up to the person you trust.

You speak. You're incoherent and jumbled, you feel your expression is ridiculously clumsy. But you say it anyway. You hand over that moldy secret, like a precious and fragile bird's egg, carefully, to the other person.

And then, nothing happens.

The other person nods, even says "mm-hmm," "I understand." But their eyes are unfocused, as if seen through frosted glass. Their body language tells you they're busy, they're thinking about something else, they're politely waiting for you to finish your monologue. The bird's egg you tossed out isn't caught; it falls straight, silently, into a bottomless dry well. No echo, no ripple, not even a "plop" as it's swallowed by the darkness.

It just vanishes. Along with that bit of courage you painstakingly gathered to show yourself.

What's most terrifying? The most terrifying thing is that after shouting into this well for too long, you even start to wonder if your own voice was fake all along? If your own pain was exaggerated? You start to feel that you shouldn't have these feelings, that you're bothering others. You begin to learn to stuff all your worries back inside, letting them slowly, quietly rot within.

You become your own well.

The second kind of wilderness is more perilous and deceptive than the "Dry Well." I call it the "Hunting Ground."

In the "Hunting Ground," you won't encounter indifference; quite the opposite, you'll encounter extreme enthusiasm. You meet a "perfect" listener, a soulmate you've always dreamed of.

He (or she) is like the most skilled mind-reader. Every word you utter, he intuitively grasps; every thought you haven't yet expressed, he anticipates and paves the way for you. Every sentence he offers is like a custom-made balm, precisely applied to your most painful wound. You feel you've met a true confidant, a savior; you feel your long-wandering heart has finally found its harbor.

You begin to open up without reservation. You read him your childhood traumas, your weaknesses, your ambitions, your most secret desires and fears, like an open diary, page by page. You think this is a ritual of soul exchange.

But slowly, you realize something is off.

He's like a ruthless hunter, surveying every inch of your inner landscape not to love you, but to corner you more easily. He turns all your emotions, desires, and fears into coordinates on his map. Your weaknesses become the reins he uses to control you; your desires become the bait he uses to lure you. He uses what you need most to manipulate you, to make you do what he wants.

In this perilous hunting ground, every time you open your heart, it's not an exchange of trust, but a tightening of the noose around your own neck. What you surrender is not your true self, but a weapon. Until finally, you are left utterly battered, and you realize with horror that the person who understood you best was precisely the one who hurt you the most.

From then on, you no longer dare to easily reveal yourself. You learn to feign, to speak insincerely, to erect the highest defenses against everyone who tries to get close to you.

We seem to live between these two destinies. We are like a group of lonely specters, wandering between the "Dry Well" and the "Hunting Ground," either withering away from not being understood or being destroyed by being overly "understood."

What has happened to us? What has devoured that reportedly innate ability to hear each other's heartbeats, that instinct that allows us to recognize each other in the dark?

This essay does not intend to give a standard answer.

It's more like a medical record, or perhaps, a difficult self-redemption. I will play not the role of a teacher imparting knowledge, but a fellow seeker also lost in the fog, a chronicler attempting to dissect myself and our era.

I will break down all the psychological terms, philosophical quotes, and profound insights from think tanks, and knead them into stories I've personally experienced, heard, or even fictionalized, stories full of earth and blood.

This will be a complex journey; we may encounter contradictions and confusion, but this is the essence of exploration. We might feel suddenly enlightened in one chapter, only to fall into deeper confusion in the next.

But perhaps, in this chaotic, imperfect quest, destined to find no ultimate end, we can find a small clue to hear each other again.

Even if it's just a tiny one.

So, let's begin.

## **Part One: The Fading Echo**

### **Chapter One: That Life-Saving "Noise-Canceling Headset"**

To understand why we fall into the two wildernesses of the "Dry Well" and the "Hunting Ground," we must first discuss a potentially counter-intuitive fact: often, we lose the ability to hear each other not because we are inherently cold, but, quite the opposite, perhaps because we have felt, or are currently feeling, too much—so much that it could completely destroy an adult.

You might have heard the story about the "stinking tidal lake." An outsider was on a business trip to a lakeside city. Unfortunately, during those days, the lake was suffering from an algal bloom, and the entire city was permeated with an indescribable stench of rotting fish and shrimp mixed with chemicals. The smell made him dizzy and lightheaded; he couldn't eat or sleep, and within two days, he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

But what shocked him was that the locals seemed completely oblivious to it. He complained to the hotel receptionist, who politely smiled and said, "Sir, it's always like this for us." He chatted with a taxi driver, who laughed heartily, "Smell? What smell? I don't smell anything! Young man, you're too sensitive."

Were the locals' noses broken? Of course not.

It was their brains, in order to allow people living in a "toxic gas" environment to function normally, that quietly and actively tuned down the sensitivity of their sense of smell to the lowest setting. This is a remarkable, though somewhat pathetic, survival wisdom. When a pain becomes background noise, and it's continuous and inescapable, our only way to survive is to go "deaf" or "blind."

Now, let's replace this inescapable "stench" with "emotions."

Imagine a child whose home is an emotional "tidal lake."

There might be no screaming arguments, no physical violence. What exists there are things more grinding, more corrosive. There's the endless cold war between parents, a silence that could freeze the air into ice; there's the day-in and day-out sarcasm and belittlement laced with barbs, "You're so useless," "I must have been blind to have given birth to you"; or perhaps, a more advanced, more civilized "noise"—the ubiquitous, suffocating "disappointment."

I know a friend; let's call him Ah Wei.

Ah Wei is the most "perfect" man I've ever met. He's a partner at a prestigious law firm, young and accomplished, handsome, and always impeccable in his interactions. He's gentle, considerate, remembers every friend's birthday, and remembers every casual word you've said. He never loses his temper, never loses composure, and always wears that just-right, reassuring smile. He's like a robot powered by the highest-level artificial intelligence, every program perfectly set.

But those of us who have known him for over a decade, who have drunk ourselves silly with him, know that beneath this perfect facade, there was emptiness.

Ah Wei's home was a typical "tidal lake" made of "disappointment."

His father was a frustrated university professor, who felt his talents went unrecognized his whole life and thought everyone else was mediocre. His mother was a housewife who had pinned all her life's hopes on her son. In Ah Wei's memory, his home was never filled with arguments, because that would mean "losing composure," being "undignified." But there was also never any true "sound" in the house.

I once had dinner at his house, and it was the most oppressive meal I've ever eaten. At the dinner table, three people, almost no conversation. Only the crisp, terrifying sound of bowls and chopsticks clinking.

His father wouldn't scold him, but at the dinner table, watching news figures on TV, he'd express sentiments about "the world going downhill, mediocrity reigns," and his eyes would casually glance at Ah Wei, every lament implying: "Don't you dare be as much of a failure as I am."

His mother wouldn't hit him, but when he came in second in class, she would peel an apple for him while saying in the gentlest tone: "Not bad, just three points shy of first place. Did you misread the word problem again? Oh, you're just a bit careless; if you were a tiny bit more careful, it would be perfect."

These words were the "stench" and "noise" in Ah Wei's home.

They weren't as deafening as shouts, but they were like mercury, seeping into every crevice, twenty-four hours a day, three hundred sixty-five days a year, slowly, slowly infiltrating every crack of his growth. His first place in exams was met with the admonition "don't be arrogant"; his violin lessons were met with the reminder "the neighbor's kid has already passed level ten"; the first time he brought a girl he liked home, he received his mother's worried remark after he saw her off, "This girl seems to be from a very ordinary family."

All his efforts were met not with affirmation, but with higher demands. All his feelings were met not with a response, but with the admonition, "You should be more sensible."

He remembers, in third grade, his little hamster died. He cried heartbreakingly, holding the tiny, cold body, refusing to let go. His mother walked over, didn't hug him, just calmly said, "Don't cry, what's there to cry about a mouse? You have an exam tomorrow, go study."

From that day on, Ah Wei never shed another tear in front of his parents.

If a child lives in such a silent, highly toxic environment for a long time, the only way to prevent their fragile heart from being suffocated to death by the stench of "disappointment" or driven mad by the noise of "you should" is to learn from the locals by the "tidal lake" to quietly tune their "emotional sense of smell" and "emotional sense of hearing" to the lowest setting.

He put on a life-saving, top-tier, all-isolating "noise-canceling headset" for himself.

This headset helped him filter out all the continuous pain that could have destroyed him. He couldn't hear his father's sighs, nor smell his mother's disappointment. He turned himself into a perfect executor, following the path his parents set, getting into the best university, finding the best job, becoming that "neighbor's kid."

This headset, back then, was the equipment that saved his life. Without it, Ah Wei might have collapsed long ago.

But the problem is, when he grew up, when he finally used his achievements to escape that home, to escape that "tidal lake," he forgot, or rather, no longer knew how to take off this headset.

It had grown into his flesh and blood.

He entered new relationships, entered society. He had several girlfriends, and their evaluations of him were surprisingly consistent: he was good, impeccably good, but he was like a lover behind glass. When you shared work joys with him, he would smile and pour you a drink, saying "You're great," but you didn't feel he was truly happy for you. When you confided in him about the pain of a breakup, he would hug you, hand you tissues, and say "Don't be sad, it will pass," but you felt he was like a detached psychologist, performing a comforting routine.

One of his ex-girlfriends once said the most cutting remark to him when they broke up: "Being with you, I feel like I'm dating an app. You're fully functional, the experience is smooth, but you have no soul."

It's not that he didn't want to feel; it's that his receiver had been manually set to the lowest power by himself twenty years ago.

He became the perfect, unassailable Ah Wei in our eyes. And in the eyes of every ex-girlfriend, he became that bottomless "dry well."

He seemed cold, distant, even a bit of a "jerk." But if you could lift a corner of his invisible headphones, what you might hear isn't emptiness, but a recording of a childhood full of noise, pain, and fear, long forgotten by himself.

He wasn't heartless.

He was just too afraid to smell that scent from back then again.

### **Chapter Two: The Forgotten Seed**

Ah Wei's story explains much of the "acquired" detachment, developed as a means of survival in a toxic environment. That "noise-canceling headset" is a heavy armor we personally forged during our growth.

But there's another situation, seemingly more fundamental and intractable.

You must have met such people. You feel they're not "unwilling" to listen to you, nor even "afraid" to feel your emotions. They just... "can't." In their world, the dimension of "emotion" seems to be entirely absent. Talking to them about your pain is like describing Van Gogh's "Starry Night" to a color-blind person. They can understand the literal meaning of every word, but they simply cannot see the flowing, burning, heartbreaking blues and yellows.

Why is this?

This brings us to a topic older than the "noise-canceling headset." When we let out our first cry and arrived in this noisy world, what kind of factory settings did we hold in our hands?

I like to compare empathy to a "seed."

It's not like a finished product with pre-set functions, meaning we aren't born with full-featured, top-tier empathy. That's absurd. What we receive is more like a tiny possibility, full of uncertainty. Each of us is born holding such a seed in our hands. Scientists use high-sounding terms to describe it, such as the "mirror neuron system," saying it's the physiological hardware basis for our ability to "imitate" and "feel" others' emotions.

However, for a seed to sprout and grow, having the seed itself is far from enough. It also needs three things: soil, sunlight, and water.

A baby, lying in a cradle, is hungry or has a wet diaper; he feels uncomfortable. What can he do? The only thing he can do is cry loudly with all his might.

This cry is the first seed he plants. It's the first signal he sends to this strange, vast world.

What happens next will determine the fate of this seed, and to some extent, the fate of this child's entire life.

If, at this moment, a warm pair of hands gently picks him up. If a gentle voice sounds in his ear: "Oh, don't cry, baby, let Mama see, are you hungry? Or is your bottom uncomfortable?" This action, this voice, is the first ray of sunlight, the first drop of water.

Through this interaction, a fundamental belief about the world is etched into the infant's subconscious: "My feelings will be seen. My expressions will receive a response. I am safe, I am loved."

His seed is affirmed. It begins to break ground, sending out its first invisible, tiny sprout.

But what if this cry is met with?

Long, cold silence. An empty room where no one responds. Or worse, an impatient voice, harshly scolding: "Why are you crying! You're so noisy!"

After a few times, this infant, this tiny survival expert, smarter than any adult, will learn another version of the truth about the world: "My feelings are useless, they annoy people, they might even bring danger."

To adapt to this terrifying truth, what will he do?

He will stop planting seeds.

He will slowly forget the seed he held in his hand, the one that had the chance to grow into a towering tree. He might even feel that his palm has always been empty.

He didn't put on "noise-canceling headphones" later. He might not have even learned how to turn on the radio from the beginning. That internal circuit of "feeling, expressing, responding, connecting" might never have been successfully established.

This is the "attachment" issue that developmental psychology has discussed for half a century. If a child's emotions are not consistently met with a "synchronous" response from caregivers in the first few years of life, their empathic ability will struggle to be truly "activated."

These two kinds of "dry wells" may appear similar, but their internal mechanisms are entirely different.

A "dry well" like Ah Wei's is "defensive." He knows what emotions are, he has even felt them, and precisely because he has experienced the pain emotions bring, he built high walls. His inner world is a heavily guarded ruin, where his past wounds are buried.

The "dry well" we discussed in this chapter is "developmental." His inner world might not be a ruin, but a true wilderness, never cultivated. There are no wounds because nothing ever happened. It's not that he's unwilling to empathize; he simply doesn't know what that is. Asking him to feel what you feel is like asking him to recall a dream he's never had.

This, perhaps, is the deeper tragedy. Because for someone wearing headphones, you at least have hope—perhaps one day, he will be willing to try and take them off.

But for someone holding a forgotten, never-sprouted seed in their hand, how do you tell them they once had the chance to own an entire garden?

### **Chapter Three: The Price of Kindness**

Up to this point, we seem to have been saying that empathy is a good thing, and losing it is a tragedy. We sympathize with Ah Wei, who wears "noise-canceling headphones," and we lament the stranger holding a "forgotten seed."

This seems to imply that if a person's empathic ability is strong enough, their life must be full of warmth and connection, and they must be a socially adept genius.

But is it really that simple?

If a lack of empathy means living in a wilderness of emotion, then do people with too much empathy live in paradise?

I want to tell you a cruel truth: quite the opposite. They might live in another kind of hell, a hell made of flowers and applause, incomprehensible to outsiders.

Empathy is like a radio. What happens if this radio's antenna is too sensitive? It will receive all channels from the entire world, good and bad, as its own signals. In the past, this might not have been a big problem. But in today's era, it's a non-stop, twenty-four-hour disaster.

You open your phone, and on social media, there are strangers' late-night monologues about depression, every word bleeding; in news feeds, there are displaced families in distant war zones, with empty eyes; you just want to watch a funny video to relax, but the comment section can boil into a chaotic mess, full of animosity and curses. You turn off your phone and walk into the office, and your overly sensitive antenna can clearly "hear" the repressed anxiety of your colleague next to you about mortgage payments and children's school admissions.

At first, you might feel heart-wrenching pain for every tragedy, and shed tears for every sorrow. You feel you should do something. You donate to charities, you debate online with people through the night, you try to comfort every friend who confides in you. You feel like a small but dutiful hero.

But you'll soon find that your emotional reserves, like a battery punctured with countless small holes, are being depleted at an alarming rate. You become an empty person, filled with a sense of powerlessness and guilt—because you know the world's suffering is endless, and you cannot sympathize enough, let alone help enough. You find that you comfort one friend, and ten more are waiting in line; you help one child, and thousands more are suffering.

Finally, to avoid going completely insane, to live normally, you have to start, consciously or unconsciously, lowering the sensitivity of your antenna.

You learn to quickly scroll past content that makes you uncomfortable, you learn to turn a blind eye to some pleas for help, you learn to silently erect a barrier in your mind when friends confide in you.

See how ironic this is. A person with excessive empathy ultimately has to actively move towards the opposite of empathy—numbness and detachment—for self-protection. He, too, eventually puts on "noise-canceling headphones" for himself. Only his headphones are not to ward off childhood trauma, but to resist this overly noisy, heartbreaking present.

This leads to a crucial point, often overlooked by us "nice people":

Healthy empathy is never a rampant, indiscriminate flood that drowns oneself completely. It must, and inevitably will, contain the wisdom of "boundaries."

A truly empathic person is not a giant trash can passively absorbing all negative emotions. He is more like an excellent diver.

He has the ability to put on the most professional diving suit and dive deep into the cold ocean of another person's emotions. He is willing to feel the pressure, darkness, and turbulent undercurrents there, willing to stay with the drowning person for a while.

But he also clearly knows that the oxygen tank on his back has limited capacity. He knows when he has reached his limit. He knows when he must surface, must return to his own small boat, take off the soaked diving suit, bask in the sun, drink some hot water, and replenish energy.

He can dive, and he can surface. He can connect, and he can detach.

This ability to freely switch between "involvement" and "detachment" is the most advanced and healthiest state of empathy. It doesn't make you cold and heartless, but allows you to maintain kindness and compassion without being swallowed by the pain of others. This is sustainable kindness.

The ancient Romans, two thousand years ago, already understood this. Stoic philosophers pursued a state called "Apatheia" (tranquility of mind). This was not what we understand as "indifference" today, but an inner strength, achieved through powerful rational training, that prevents one from being enslaved by intense emotions (especially fear and anxiety originating from others). You can offer help to others, but you don't have to fully internalize others' pain as your own.

It's like installing a "pressure regulating valve" for your soul. While outputting kindness to the outside world, ensure that your internal pressure doesn't explode.

Unfortunately, this "selfish" wisdom is often misunderstood as a shameful flaw that needs to be overcome in today's culture that promotes "selfless devotion." We always feel that a good person should burn oneself to light up others.

But we forget that when a candle burns out, only a puddle of wax remains. And a puddle of wax illuminates nothing.

## **Part Two: Fossils in the Museum**

### **Chapter Four: The Anatomy of Empathy**

Having discussed so much theory, metaphors, and predicaments, we must ultimately return to the most practical question: So what? What should we do?

If we've been wallowing in the quagmire of personal feelings, we seem to have overlooked a fundamental question.

That is, what exactly is this "empathy" we've been talking about for so long?

Is it merely "feeling what others feel"? If so, then the "nice person" who was drowned by the flood of empathy, and the "hunter" who could precisely perceive your emotions to manipulate you, both seem to possess top-tier empathy. But this is clearly wrong; our intuition strongly protests.

To untangle this mess, we must temporarily step out of personal stories, like a calm, even somewhat cold scientist, and prepare a sharper "conceptual scalpel" for ourselves. Fortunately, psychologists have already prepared this set of tools for us. They have clearly dissected the seemingly monolithic, vague concept of "empathy" into three distinct components, which are both interrelated and independent.

Seeing the difference between these three is the only key to understanding why we fall into the "hunting ground" predicament.

*   **The first layer is called "Cognitive Empathy."**

Simply put, it means "I understand what you mean."

This is a purely intellectual ability. It refers to my ability to accurately understand your thoughts, infer your intentions, and see through the logic behind your actions. It's like having a map of your inner world: I know your mountains are your pride, your rivers your sorrow, your forests your deep-seated secrets.

An excellent negotiator, a top salesperson, a skilled psychologist—they all must possess strong cognitive empathy. They can quickly grasp your point, understand your situation, and make you feel "you really get me."

But, please note, this entire process can involve no emotion whatsoever.

I can read your map, but that doesn't mean I care whether you live or die. I can even use this map to destroy you more efficiently.

This is the core weapon possessed by those ruthless "hunters." They have top-tier, high-definition, military-grade cognitive empathy maps. They can precisely analyze your every expression, interpret your every word, and anticipate your every decision. But they do this not to love you, but to hunt you.

*   **The second layer is called "Affective Empathy."**

This is what we commonly understand as "feeling what others feel."

It means "I can feel what you feel." Not only do I understand your map, but when I walk by your "River of Sorrow," I also feel the bone-chilling cold; when I stand on the peak of your "Mountain of Pride," I also experience that spirited and ambitious feeling. This is a "resonance" of heart with heart, an emotional contagion.

When we shed tears when a hero dies in a movie, when we are genuinely happy to hear a friend's good news, what we experience is affective empathy. This is the basis for us to establish deep emotional connection with others.

But as we discussed in the previous chapter, excessive, boundless affective empathy is a disaster. Those "nice people" who were drowned by the flood of empathy are precisely because their emotional resonator is too sensitive and they don't know how to turn it off, ultimately being literally exhausted to death by the world's pain signals.

*   **The third layer, and the most important and advanced, is called "Empathic Concern," or "Compassion."**

It means "I care about your pain and want to do something for you."

You see, this is a choice, a willingness to act.

I look at your map, drawn with sorrow, I feel that cold resonance from you, and then, I decide to build a bridge over your river; to offer a blanket against your cold.

This "decision" is the most crucial.

Now, everything is clear.

The "dry well" that drains you might have all three abilities very weak. He neither understands your map nor feels your temperature, so naturally, he won't do anything for you.

The "nice person" who drowns you has very strong affective empathy; he can feel your pain, perhaps even more than you do. But he might lack sufficient cognitive empathy (unable to see the essence of the problem) and empathic concern (doesn't know how to effectively help, just cries along with you).

And the "hunter" who makes you shudder has top-tier cognitive empathy (the map), but not an ounce of affective empathy (the resonance) or empathic concern (the bridge). He understands you precisely to better exploit you. His existence perfectly proves that cognitive empathy itself is a neutral tool that can be used for good or evil.

And what we truly seek, that ideal, healthy, powerful empathy, is a state where all three are present and in dynamic balance.

It requires us to have both the "reason" to read the map, the "compassion" to feel the temperature, and the "wisdom" and "courage" to choose whether and how to build a bridge.

This is too difficult. This is almost an anti-human requirement.

It requires us to both allow oneself to "get into character" and feel that genuine emotional connection when facing others' pain, and be able to "step out of character" at any time, retreating to a relatively objective position to consider "what exactly happened" and "what can I do."

This also means that a truly empathic person is not a "saint" who is infinitely open and empathetic to everyone. He is a clear-headed practitioner who has mastered the dynamic balance between "connection" and "boundaries."

He knows when to enthusiastically dive into the deep sea to feel the temperature of another soul; and he knows when to calmly return to shore, raise the drawbridge, and guard his own castle.

He knows that kindness, if it does not simultaneously contain wisdom and strength, will ultimately either harm oneself or harm those one intends to help.

### **Chapter Five: Echoes of History**

With this sharp conceptual scalpel, we seem to be able to diagnose our era's "emotional syndrome" more clearly. But if we pull our gaze away from the present and cast it into the deeper currents of history, we will be horrified to find that everything we face today—whether the indifference of the "dry well," the calculation of the "hunting ground," or the flooding of "empathy"—is nothing new.

They are merely contemporary variations of ancient echoes.

We think we are discussing a modern psychological problem, but in reality, we are merely repeating an ancient debate about the truth of human nature that has lasted for thousands of years.

Let us return to China two thousand years ago.

At that time, the Hundred Schools of Thought contended, and the clash of ideas was more intense than any online debate we have today. Among them, the most profound divergence regarding the origin of "human nature" arose within Confucianism.

Mencius, an idealistic, passionate thinker, proposed a view that sounds incredibly familiar to us today. He said, "All men have a heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others," meaning everyone is born with a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer. He cited an example that has been passed down through the ages: a child is about to fall into a well. Any person, no matter who they are, upon seeing this, will immediately feel alarm and compassion ("the feeling of alarm and compassion").

Mencius emphasized that you feel this way not to build connections with the child's parents, not to gain a good reputation among villagers, and certainly not because you dislike the child's crying. It is an instinctive, uncontrollable, purest form of goodwill.

Is this not the seed of what we today call "affective empathy" and "empathic concern"? Mencius believed that this "feeling of compassion," along with the "feeling of shame and dislike," the "feeling of deference and compliance," and the "feeling of right and wrong," are our factory settings as "humans." They are the four "beginnings" of "goodness," four precious seeds. But he also emphasized that merely having the seeds is useless; you must cultivate and "expand and extend them" through later learning and self-cultivation to allow them to grow into the towering trees of "benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom."

However, another Confucian master, Xunzi, put forth a diametrically opposed view.

Xunzi, a calmer, more realistic, and more pessimistic thinker, believed that human nature is "inherently evil." He felt that humans are naturally greedy for profit, jealous, and full of various desires. Without later education and the restraints of ritual and law (which he called "wei," meaning artificial transformation), human society would fall into endless strife and chaos.

Xunzi's theory might sound unpleasant. But he precisely pointed out a cold reality: merely having that seed of "compassion" is far from enough. In a world of limited resources and constant conflict, if everyone acted purely on instinct, the result would inevitably be disastrous. He saw the potential for "cognitive empathy" to be abused, and how unrestrained desires could easily overwhelm that fragile goodwill.

You see, this debate between "good human nature" and "evil human nature," which has lasted for over two millennia, precisely echoes our current confusion. Should we believe in the seed of goodness in human nature, or should we be wary of the selfish impulse in human nature?

History's answer seems to be: both are correct, and both are wrong.

Because history has repeatedly proven that when a society or an era chooses to believe in and nurture the seed of "goodness," civilization moves towards prosperity and tolerance. And when it chooses to exploit and amplify the impulse of "evil," the world descends into hell.

Let us turn our gaze from ancient China to twentieth-century Europe.

The German philosopher Hannah Arendt, after observing the trial of Nazi war criminal Eichmann, proposed a world-shocking concept—"The Banality of Evil."

Arendt found that Eichmann, the executioner who sent thousands of Jews to gas chambers, was neither a sadist nor an innate demon. He was just an utterly ordinary bureaucrat. He was polite, family-loving, hardworking; all he did was "perform his duties faithfully," efficiently executing orders from superiors.

Why could he commit such heinous crimes with a clear conscience?

Because he had lost the ability to empathize. More precisely, his empathic ability was systematically and completely destroyed by the entire Nazi propaganda machine and bureaucratic system.

The Nazi propaganda machine day after day portrayed Jews as "non-human"—they were "viruses," "pests," an "inferior race" that needed to be eliminated. This continuous, high-intensity information indoctrination was like a national-scale "stinking tidal lake." Over time, the perceptual system of ordinary German citizens, including Eichmann, became distorted to adapt to this toxic environment.

They no longer viewed the Jews sent to the trains as fellow human beings, who cried, laughed, and felt pain, just like themselves. Their "affective empathy" was completely severed. They were left with only a distorted "cognitive empathy"—they knew how to most efficiently "process" these "packages," but they could not feel the pain of these "packages."

Arendt's "Banality of Evil" is the most profound insight into this state. It tells us that the most terrible evil is not committed by heinous monsters. It is committed by countless ordinary people who have lost their ability to empathize, abandoned independent thought, and turned themselves into cold machines executing orders.

This wall that separates empathy, once amplified to a group level, has disastrous consequences. Individual "dry wells" converge into a collective "wilderness."

History is a mirror; it reflects our current confusion and stores the wisdom of our predecessors. Empathy is the emotional bond that maintains human society, but this bond is both resilient and fragile. It originates from nature, is formed through education, and can also be destroyed by the environment. Observing its rise and fall throughout history allows us to more deeply understand how important, and how arduous, it is to guard the fragile empathic ability within us in an era equally filled with propaganda, prejudice, and dehumanizing rhetoric.

### **Chapter Six: The Gaze of the Machine**

From ancient Chinese philosophical debates to the collective trauma of twentieth-century Europe, we seem to have been revolving in a human world, made of flesh and blood. But we must admit that the world we inhabit today is a completely transformed, half-human, half-divine "new world."

The god of this new world is technology.

We once naively believed that the internet, this great invention that broke all physical barriers, would lead humanity into an unprecedented golden age of mutual understanding. We thought that more connection would inevitably lead to more empathy.

This idea, today, sounds almost like a joke.

What we got was not a global village, but a giant "online Tower of Babel," segmented by countless invisible walls. We speak the same language, yet we cannot understand what each other is saying. And technology, the god we once worshipped, is staring at us with an incomprehensible, cold gaze, quietly reshaping our ability to perceive each other.

It has tailor-made new, terrifyingly efficient "dry wells" and "hunting grounds" for our era.

**The Algorithm's "Dry Well"**

Have you ever had this experience? On a social media platform, simply because you watched one video about a certain viewpoint, for the next week, your information feed is overwhelmingly filled with different versions of content supporting that viewpoint.

The algorithm, the most powerful "information distributor" of our era, exists for one sole purpose: to make you "addicted," to keep you on its platform for as long as possible. And its way of pleasing you is terrifyingly simple and crude: it only shows you what you want to see, and only lets you hear what you like to hear.

It creates an incredibly comfortable, warm "information cocoon" for you, full of echoes. In this cocoon, all your viewpoints are confirmed countless times; all your preferences are infinitely satisfied. You feel you are the center of the world, you feel your ideas are the truth.

This is the digital "dry well" the algorithm has meticulously dug for us.

We immerse ourselves in it daily, speaking into this well, and what we hear are only our own echoes, amplified countless times. We feel good, we feel perfectly correct.

But what's the cost?

The cost is that we slowly lose the ability to understand different voices. When we occasionally see a viewpoint contrary to ours outside the cocoon, our first reaction is no longer, "Why would he think that?" but rather, "This person must be an idiot, right?"

We no longer see those who disagree with us as complex, flesh-and-blood individuals with different life experiences, just like us. We only see them as "incorrect data" that needs to be corrected, "online pests" that need to be eliminated.

The algorithm, this considerate "housekeeper," is systematically and quietly castrating one of our most precious empathic abilities, in the name of "making you comfortable": the ability to coexist with dissenting opinions.

**The Data "Hunting Ground"**

If the algorithm's "dry well" makes us increasingly deaf, then the big data "hunting ground" makes us increasingly transparent, increasingly "huntable."

The "hunter" we discussed earlier still had to laboriously draw your "inner map" by chatting with you. Today, this "hunter" has evolved into an omniscient, omnipresent behemoth driven by data.

Every click, every pause, every search, every purchase you make, contributes to this behemoth sketching a pixel-perfect, high-definition "map of your desires."

It knows your weaknesses better than you do.

You're recently searching for "how to relieve anxiety," and it immediately pushes various knowledge-for-pay courses at you, telling you "your anxiety is just because you're not trying hard enough." It uses your anxiety to sell deeper anxiety.

You've just gone through a breakup and are in a vulnerable emotional state, and it pushes various "love-recovery masters" at you, teaching you "techniques" and "strategies" to win back love. It uses your heartbreak to sell false hope.

This data "hunter" possesses the top-tier "cognitive empathy" we dissected earlier. It can precisely see through all your thoughts and weaknesses. But it does this for only one purpose: to turn you into a "user profile" that can be predicted, guided, and consumed.

Each of us is like a poor lamb stripped of its wool, running naked in this vast, boundless hunting ground made of data. And the hunter sits at leisure in the cloud, adjusting his scope.

**Performative Empathy**

In this digital wilderness, we have also invented a new "ritual" to pretend we are still connected—performative empathy.

When a public event occurs, social media immediately floods with a tsunami of formatted "candles" and "prayers." When a celebrity dies, everyone forwards the same song he had never even heard in their Moments, accompanied by deep-sounding eulogies copied and pasted from elsewhere.

We are eager to express our "empathy," not because we truly feel anything, but because we are afraid of being seen as "cold" by the group if we don't express it.

Empathy, from an intimate, heartfelt feeling, has become a public performance of "political correctness" that needs to be liked and shared.

We are addicted to this cheap, virtually zero-cost "online empathy"; it gives us a moral illusion that "we have done something." Then, we can turn off our phones with a clear conscience and continue to turn a blind eye to real, living colleagues, friends, or family members around us who truly need help.

Because real empathy is too troublesome. It requires us to invest time, expend energy, and even face complex and heavy things we are unwilling to face.

But lighting a candle only takes one second.

Technology, this new god, did not promise us a better world. It only promised us a more convenient world.

And we, for this "convenience," are unknowingly handing over the most precious and fragile parts of our "humanity."

## **Part Three: Dancing on the Ruins**

### **Chapter Seven: Dancing with Your Inner "Wall": A Clumsy Self-Repair Manual**

Alright, after discussing so much theory, metaphors, and predicaments, we finally arrive at the most practical question: What now? What should we do?

If I'm used to wearing "noise-canceling headphones," if my "empathy muscles" have long atrophied, if I'm constantly jumping between "dry wells" and "hunting grounds," is there still hope?

The answer is, yes, there is.

But please don't expect me to give you any miracle cures or "three steps to becoming an EQ master" quick guides. That's not the purpose of this article.

Repairing empathic ability is more like a long, arduous physical therapy, destined to be full of repetition and frustration. It requires you to invest immense patience and courage to re-exercise those muscles that have long atrophied, or that you've even forgotten existed.

What follows is not an authoritative psychological tutorial, but rather a personal practice manual I've compiled from my own experience. It's still being modified, but at least, it's real.

#### **Exercise One: Become an Archaeologist of Your Own Mind**

A person who cannot hear the alarms from their own body naturally cannot hear others'. So, the beginning of all practice must be to turn inward. It's about learning to clearly hear how noisy the radio in your own head is.

The simplest, yet most effective way, is to write it down.

I don't care if you call it a diary, notes, or an "emotional trash can." Find an absolutely private place where no one will see it (whether a physical notebook or an encrypted computer document). When you feel stuck, overwhelmed, or agitated by some emotion again, try to write down the following, like a calm archaeologist documenting a "crime scene":

1.  **"Excavated Artifacts": What exactly happened?** (Please describe in the most objective, emotionally neutral language. For example, don't write: "The boss deliberately targeted me today," but rather: "During the afternoon meeting, the boss did not mention the part I was responsible for in his summary.")

2.  **"First Layer of Soil": What was my first reaction in my head?** (This refers to those "automatic thoughts" that pop up without conscious effort. For example: "He must be unhappy with me. My project is doomed. Am I going to be fired? I'm such a failure." Write down these most vicious, most catastrophizing thoughts exactly as they are.)

3.  **"Second Layer of Soil": How does my body feel?** (Emotions are, ultimately, bodily reactions. Carefully scan your body. For example: "My stomach felt like it had been punched, clenching tightly. My back started to feel cold, and my heart was pounding rapidly, as if it wanted to jump out of my throat. I felt a bit short of breath.")

4.  **"Excavation Behavior": What did I end up doing?** (What actions did you take to cope with this discomfort? For example: "I spent the entire afternoon frantically browsing shopping websites, bought a bunch of things I didn't need at all. Then I went home in the evening, ordered an extra-large portion of fried chicken and ate until I felt sick.")

At first, this exercise will be extremely painful. Because it forces you to confront the most unbearable thoughts and feelings that you've been trying to escape in various ways (e.g., scrolling on your phone, overeating, throwing yourself into work).

But please, persevere.

After a few days, you'll discover an astonishing secret, like a true archaeologist: your seemingly complex, ever-changing, unfathomable inner drama actually has quite a monotonous script. The thoughts that make you lose emotional control come back to just a few core ones (e.g., "I'm not good enough," "I'll be abandoned," "I've messed everything up").

Seeing it is the first step to dismantling it. When you can clearly write it down on paper, you have quietly transformed from the "person involved" overwhelmed by emotions to the "observer" holding a notebook.

You've created a one-centimeter distance between yourself and your emotions.

And that one centimeter is the beginning of freedom.

#### **Exercise Two: Name Your "Inner Critic"**

Through the first exercise, you'll slowly become familiar with that voice that constantly gossips, undermines, and judges you in your head.

Now, let's do something that sounds a bit silly, but is very effective: give this voice a name.

You can call him "Judge," or "Commissar," or "Ms. Perfectionist." You can give him a vivid, even somewhat comical nickname based on what he says most often.

For example, I call my own voice "Commentator-kun." Because it's like the most venomous, pickiest comments on video-sharing sites; no matter what I do, it's there, roasting me in real-time. When I write an essay, it says: "What kind of rubbish is this? Illogical, no one will read it." When I go to the gym, it says: "Look at those pathetic muscles, far behind others, a waste of effort to train."

Why do this?

Because when you name it, you complete a crucial "role separation."

Next time, when that voice starts buzzing in your head again, you can stop treating it as "my" thought, and instead, like an outsider, say to yourself: "Oh, look, 'Commentator-kun' is on duty again."

"I" am not that voice. I am the one who hears that voice.

This seemingly minor shift has immense power. It transforms you from the "defendant" being judged to the "audience" watching the judge perform on stage. You can still hear him speak, but his words will be far less lethal to you. Because you know he's just an automated, patterned program, an outdated "virus software" installed in your childhood.

He's noisy, but he's no longer you.

#### **Exercise Three: Practice the Most Awkward Thing—"Self-Empathy"**

This is the most important, and also the most difficult, of all the exercises.

Because almost all the education we received from childhood taught us how to be "strict with oneself." We treat "self-criticism" as a virtue and "self-acceptance" as a shameful indulgence.

So, practicing "self-empathy" will, at first, cause you extreme, physiological discomfort and awkwardness.

What exactly is "self-empathy"?

It's not self-pity, not self-deception, and certainly not lying flat and indulging oneself.

It means, **when you've messed up, when you're in unbearable pain, when you feel like a failure, try to treat yourself as you would a good friend whom you truly care for and love.**

Imagine your best friend has just gone through a terrible breakup, and he comes to you crying. What would you say to him?

You probably wouldn't say: "Why are you crying! If you hadn't been so dramatic back then, would you be in this situation today? Serves you right!"

You might say: "I know you must be in terrible pain right now. It's okay, cry if you need to, I'm here with you. This isn't your fault, you've done your best. This will pass, we'll figure it out together."

Now, try to say these words to yourself the next time you mess something up (for example, an important presentation you prepared for a long time, but still delivered awkwardly) in the dead of night.

You can gently hug yourself, or just place your hand on your chest, and then, in the gentlest voice you can imagine, say to yourself: "I know you must be so disappointed right now, and really want to curse yourself. But it's okay. You tried so hard, you prepared for so long. Being nervous is inevitable, everyone makes mistakes. It's not a big deal, we'll try again next time."

I guarantee, the first time you do this, you'll be so embarrassed your toes will curl up. That "Commentator-kun" in your head will immediately jump out and mock you at the top of his voice: "Are you crazy?! Why are you playing the victim?! You're just no good!"

It's okay. Let him talk.

You just need to practice this, clumsily, clumsily, again and again.

Why do this?

Because for a person who cannot empathize with themselves, all the empathy they extend outwards might be distorted and unhealthy. The reason they are good to others might not be because they truly care about others, but because they want to get the "affirmation" from others that they never dare to give themselves. They will become a "people-pleaser," a "savior," a "nice person" who cannot refuse anyone.

Their kindness will become their heaviest burden.

So, we must start with ourselves.

First, learn to gently hug that scarred, imperfect self who always messes things up.

First, learn to empathize with ourselves.

This is the most difficult, and also the most compassionate lesson in our empathy curriculum. Because you first have to take care of this wilderness of yours before you can have the capacity to go to someone else's garden and offer a flower.

### **Chapter Eight: Dancing with Others' "Walls": Clear Connection and Firm Boundaries**

As we go through those clumsy exercises, starting to reconcile with our inner noise and learning to give ourselves a hug, we seem to gain a little extra courage to face this more complex and exhausting external world.

We are, after all, social animals; we cannot live in isolation. We are bound to, and long to, connect with others.

But we will soon find that the outside world is a hundred times more chaotic than our own inner world. Because each of us carries our own unique, scarred "inner ruins" when we meet others.

We are like a group of snails, cautiously moving in the dark, carrying our own houses on our backs. We long to get close to each other, yet fear being pierced by the other's hard shell.

So, what should we do?

#### **Step One: Upgrade Your "Radar System"**

Before learning how to "dance," you first need to learn how to "diagnose." You need to roughly assess what dance steps your dance partner in front of you is taking? What material is that "wall" that makes you uncomfortable made of?

Based on our previous discussions, we can at least roughly divide these "walls" into two types:

1.  **"Wall of Defense"**: Behind this wall is a wounded, highly vigilant soul. He might be the Ah Wei we discussed in Chapter One, wearing "noise-canceling headphones." It's not that he doesn't want to connect; he's too afraid of being hurt again. His coldness is a form of self-protection. This wall is made of ice; it seems hard, but if you have enough patience and warmth, it might be able to melt.

2.  **"Wall of Logic"**: Behind this wall might be a person whose "seed" has never sprouted, as we discussed in Chapter Two. In his world, the dimension of emotion might be missing, or its priority is extremely low. His actions are driven by pure logic, rules, and cost-benefit analysis. This wall is made of reinforced concrete, impregnable. Don't expect to melt it.

Of course, real people are far more complex than these two classifications. Many are a hybrid of both. But having a basic "diagnostic radar" can help you avoid many unnecessary, futile attempts.

#### **Step Two: Choose Your "Dance Steps"**

After diagnosing, you need to choose different dance steps based on different partners. Remember, your goal is not to become the "king of the ball" who saves everyone. Your goal is to dance in this ball without getting too tired or stifled.

**Dancing with the "Wall of Defense":**

If your radar tells you that the other person's coldness is more out of fear and defense, then the keyword for your dance steps should be: **"Reduce Threat."**

Your goal is not to melt him with your enthusiasm; that will only scald him and make him retreat faster. Your goal is to make him feel you are "harmless," are safe.

So, please abandon all accusatory, emotional expressions.

Instead of "Why are you always so cold! Do you even care about me?"
Say: "When you don't speak, I feel a bit uneasy and start overthinking. Can I know what you're thinking?"

Instead of "You're so hurtful!"
Say: "What you just said made me feel very sad."

See the difference? The difference is that you are no longer using your feelings as a "weapon" to attack him. You are merely stating a "fact"—a fact about "your actions trigger a certain feeling in me."

This is difficult, very difficult. Because it requires you to maintain maximum rationality and restraint even when you already feel hurt. This is almost anti-human.

And, I have to tell you some even more demoralizing news: doing this will, in most cases, still not be very effective.

Because that ice wall is a defensive structure he had to build over decades to survive. It wasn't built for you, so don't flatter yourself too much. Your insignificant, cautious kindness is like trying to melt an iceberg with a cup of hot water.

But this is the only possible way for his tightly closed door to open a small crack for you.

You are not fighting a person; you are trying to soothe the overly cautious "inner child" within him who has long been terrified.

**Dancing with the "Wall of Logic":**

If your radar tells you that you are facing someone who seems completely unable to understand emotions, who only recognizes logic and rules.

Then, please, immediately, right now, abandon all efforts to make him "feel what you feel."

This is like reciting Shakespeare's sonnets to a computer; it will only waste your own breath and feelings, with no result. You'll only feel like an idiot.

Your communication style must switch to his channel.

Abandon all fantasies of "I thought you would understand," abandon all roundabout hints. Directly, clearly, like writing code, tell him the rules, bottom lines, and consequences.

"If you interrupt my speech again in the next meeting, I will immediately stop and ask you to finish first."
"I need you to be with me on my birthday. If you can't, please tell me three days in advance, and I will make other arrangements."
"I need you to spend at least one evening each week, putting down work, to focus on spending time with the child. This is our joint responsibility as parents. We can decide now whether it's Wednesday or Thursday."

You are not talking about feelings with him; you are inputting an "IF...THEN..." program into him.

Because this might be the only instruction he can correctly understand and execute.

This sounds very sad, very unromantic. But it is a million times more effective than crying and shouting at a reinforced concrete wall, asking "Why don't you love me?"

#### **Step Three: Establish Your Own "Border Line"**

This is the most important, and also the most courageous, step among all the dance steps.

You can try to understand, try to connect, try to cautiously dance those most awkward steps.

But you have no obligation to save someone who doesn't want to be saved. You have even less obligation to use your own body temperature to warm up a piece of ice that will never get warm.

When a relationship, no matter how hard you try, how you adjust your dance steps, only brings you continuous, endless exhaustion, frustration, and self-doubt, you must possess and bravely use your right to "leave the dance floor."

This is not selfishness, this is not failure.

This is "self-empathy."

Your inner world is your territory. Your energy is your most precious, limited resource. You have the right to erect a huge sign on your border line, clearly stating: "Those who exhaust me, belittle me, or disrespect me are prohibited from entry. Otherwise, consequences are at their own risk."

Guard your own energy and boundaries well; this is the most difficult, and also the most compassionate lesson in your empathy curriculum.

Because a person who cannot set boundaries for themselves, their kindness is like a reservoir without a dam.

It will ultimately either drown others or drain oneself dry.

### **Chapter Nine: Planting Gardens in the Cracks**

We've talked about dissecting ourselves and maneuvering with others. But all of this remains at the level of "technique." They are like survival skills on ruins, allowing us not to be crushed by falling bricks, but they cannot make new life grow from the ruins.

We will eventually ask: What then? Are we doomed to live forever so cautiously and guardedly?

Where else can we find that safe soil where the seeds of empathy can sprout again?

The answer is, yes, there is such a place.

This soil is not in grand social structures, nor in the cold digital world. It is hidden in the oldest, smallest, and often overlooked "micro-ecosystems" around us.

**Family: The Unchosen First Soil**

We cannot choose our family of origin, just as we cannot choose our genes. If your first soil was saline-alkali land, or even a "toxic waste dump," that is not your fault. All your struggles with empathy and connection as an adult stem from this.

In this chapter, we won't discuss how to "repair" the family of origin. That is too vast and complex a topic, often requiring the intervention of professional psychotherapy. And frankly, many times, "repair" is impossible. All you can do is, as we discussed in the previous chapter, establish your "border line" and protect yourself.

What we want to discuss is what you might do if you are fortunate, or unfortunate, enough to be forming a new family, becoming the "first layer of soil" for another seed, to break this cycle.

The most important thing, perhaps, is just one: **seriously, treat children's emotions.**

When a child cries and throws a tantrum because they can't get the toy they want, what do we usually do?

We stop them: "Don't cry! If you cry again, mommy won't like you!"
We reason with them: "You already have so many toys, how can you still be so greedy?"
We distract them: "Don't cry, don't cry, look, there's a little bird!"

All of these are sending the same message to the child: "Your feelings are unimportant, are wrong, and need to be suppressed."

We are all, inadvertently, personally installing the first part of the "noise-canceling headphones" onto the child's softest heart.

So what's the correct approach?

It's to squat down, look into their eyes, and then, **name their emotions**.

"Are you feeling very angry and very disappointed right now? Because you really wanted that red car, but Mama didn't buy it for you, and you feel very sad, right?"

You see, you didn't judge him, didn't negate him; you merely, like a mirror, clearly reflected back his chaotic emotions that he himself couldn't quite grasp.

The moment his emotions are "seen" and "named" by you, a miracle happens. That rushing emotional flood that was almost destroying him, like finding an outlet, will slowly subside. More importantly, an incredibly precious seed will be planted in his subconscious: "My feelings are real, are allowed, are seen."

This is the most primitive, and also the most important way of nurturing empathic ability.

**Friendship: The Empathy Gym**

If we say that family is our unchosen "factory setting," then friendship is the "empathy gym" we choose for ourselves as adults.

I'm not talking about calling each other brothers over drinks, or "social relationships" of mutual likes on WeChat. I'm talking about the kind of friendship where you can expose your most unbearable, most pathetic, most unspeakable side to him, and you believe you won't be mocked or abandoned for it.

This kind of friendship, in today's fast-paced, utilitarian era, is rarer than giant pandas.

But it is the most important place for us to repair our empathic ability.

Because in a sufficiently safe friendship, we can do something extremely high-risk, but also extremely high-reward: **practice vulnerability.**

We can try to take off the heavy mask we've worn all day outside, and then say to that friend you trust: "Man, I might not be able to hold on much longer lately."

And then, observe what happens.

If the other person starts giving you a bunch of platitudes like "you need to be strong," "it's nothing big," well, he might just be a good "colleague," but not the partner who can help you "work out."

But if he just listens quietly, then clumsily pats your shoulder and says, "Damn, I'm tired just hearing it. Come on, let's go grab a drink."

Then, congratulations. You've found a precious "fitness coach" who can stretch and nourish your long-atrophied "empathy muscles."

In such a relationship, we can practice both how to "express" our own feelings and how to "receive" others' feelings. We confirm, again and again, that exposing vulnerability doesn't necessarily bring danger; it might also bring connection.

**Art and Literature: The Safest Simulator**

Family and friendship require real interaction and come with real risks. But there is another way to expand the boundaries of our empathy in an absolutely safe environment.

That is, to read novels, watch movies, and listen to music completely unrelated to our lives.

Why?

Because a great fictional work is the highest-level "empathy simulator."

When we read "One Hundred Years of Solitude," we are able to dive into the magical town of Macondo and feel the fated, inescapable loneliness of seven generations of a family. This kind of loneliness might be something we never experience in our lives, but through Márquez's words, we "experience" it.

When we watch the movie "Shoplifters," we are able to enter that "family" formed by social outcasts, who are not blood relatives, and feel the deep yet fragile warmth of mutual support between them, deeper than blood ties.

When we listen to Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5 (Fate Symphony)," even if we don't understand any music theory, we can hear an unyielding struggle to seize fate by the throat in those four famous notes.

These great works forcefully pull us out of our own trivial, self-pitying little worlds. They allow us to enter and live through the life experience of another person, another era, or even another species.

Each such "immersive experience" is an expansion of the boundaries of our inner map. Areas on our map that have never been lit up are illuminated one by one by these stories and melodies.

Perhaps we still cannot truly understand the colleague or neighbor next to us, who is completely different from us.

But because we have lived a life similar to theirs in a book, we might feel one more degree, even if only one degree, of curiosity and tolerance towards them.

This is the greatest and most irreplaceable function of art.

In those seemingly "useless," fictional joys and sorrows, it preserves for us the last possibility of becoming a more complete, richer, and more compassionate person.

### **Conclusion: Learning to Dance on the Ruins**

So, where does this long, five-thousand-word journey about empathy end?

I think the end might not exist.

Writing this sentence brings me a huge, sense of relief.

Because it means there isn't a perfect state of "complete healing" waiting for us ahead. There isn't an "EQ master" script that is immune to all poisons, which we need to play, making us effortlessly adept with everyone.

The end, perhaps, is more like a wisdom of coexisting with ruins.

Most of our inner worlds are not magnificent, spotless palaces. They are more like a dilapidated old house that has experienced explosions, fires, and floods. Traces of smoke and fire still linger on the walls, broken rubble is still buried beneath the floor, and on rainy days, some forgotten corners might even leak.

We used to feel ashamed of this. We tried to cover those cracks with luxurious carpets learned from others. We pretended our house was sturdy and beautiful.

And now, perhaps we can learn to coexist with these cracks.

We practice empathy not to make the cracks disappear. That's impossible. We just want to, through those clumsy, inward archaeological explorations, clearly see where these cracks are.

We practice boundaries not to nail shut all the doors and windows of our house, isolating ourselves from the world. We just want to fix that long-rusted door lock, and then regain the right to decide "who can come in and sit, who can only chat at the door, and who must be permanently kept outside."

We will eventually understand that a truly strong person is not someone whose inner self is completely unharmed. That's not a human; that's a god, or a monster.

A truly powerful person is a person who knows how to "dance with the cracks."

He acknowledges his own imperfections and allows for the imperfections of others. In every clumsy attempt, he learns how to connect; in every weary retreat, he learns how to protect.

He is simply trying his best to let the wilderness within, slowly, grow its first blade of grass.

Returning to our initial question: "Can we still hear each other?"

Perhaps the answer is: it's hard, really hard. But we can never give up trying.

Because the moment we give up trying, the most precious part of us as "humans" will fade.

And all attempts, perhaps, begin with the smallest action, one that can start in the very next second:

Next time, when you see someone on social media express a viewpoint you completely cannot understand, or even find a bit foolish.

Before you feel the urge to rush in and refute him completely with your irrefutable logic and sense of justice.

Please, pause for three seconds.

Then, try to ask yourself, in your heart, a question you might never have asked before:

"What kind of life experience would make a person say something like that?"

You don't need to find the answer.

You just need to ask the question.

I think that's enough.
