## Introduction: Lost in Our Own Home

I've known Yuan Zhou for many years.

In our circle of friends, he's always been like an "honor student." Graduating from a prestigious university, he quickly joined a reputable company, holding a respectable position with a considerable income. What's more commendable is that he hasn't succumbed to the slick cynicism that often comes with success; he maintains an intellectual and clear-sighted scrutiny of the world. His bookshelf is one of the few I've seen that's genuinely used for reading, not just decoration, covering a wide range from philosophy and history to cognitive science.

Logically, such a person should be resolute and composed, a master of his own life. Yet, I always sensed an inexplicable "stuttering" in him. Like a top-tier computer with all the latest software installed, but occasionally dropping frames, freezing, or even crashing without warning during operation.

That summer night, we sat in his study. Outside, the city's neon lights never dimmed, but inside, it was unusually quiet. He had just finished a week of exhausting work and was slumped in the sofa, looking somewhat weary. He got up, picked up a thick notebook from his desk, and handed it to me.

"Look," he said with a wry smile, "this is my new planner."

I took it. It was meticulously filled with various goals, action plans, and self-motivational phrases, written in three different colored pens. From quarterly career plans to tomorrow morning's wake-up time and duration of aerobic exercise, everything was clearly marked. In the blank spaces on the pages, there were even quotes from famous people, like "Your hesitation is handing your life over to others."

"Theoretically, I should be making progress, right?" He rubbed his temples. "I've read books on habit formation, I know about building micro-habits and positive feedback; I've learned time management techniques, understanding how to prioritize and manage urgency; I even signed up for a mindfulness meditation class and spend ten minutes every day clumsily practicing breath observation. But every morning when I wake up, it feels like my computer has force-restarted. All the resolutions and insights from yesterday vanish, and I'm back to my familiar procrastinating and anxious self."

He paused, his voice dropping, as if sharing a secret.

"What frightens me most is that I feel like a stranger lives inside my body. My rational self knows I should turn off the computer and go to the gym, or calm down and write that report I've been putting off. But that 'stranger' seems to have a brute force, holding me firmly in my chair, making my fingers unconsciously open one irrelevant webpage after another. I don't even know him, don't know what he wants, yet I'm completely controlled by him."

He looked out the window. The city's clamor seemed to rush in at that moment, only to be silently blocked by the glass.

"You know," he finally said, his voice as light as a sigh, "I'm like someone living in a house I designed and built brick by brick, but I'm lost."

Yuan Zhou was right.

His dilemma, to varying degrees, is what many of us are experiencing, isn't it? We live in an era where knowledge is unprecedentedly accessible. We have countless tools and methodologies to analyze and improve ourselves, yet at the same time, we feel an unprecedented disconnect from our true selves.

Each of us has such a building within us. It's not made of steel and concrete, but constructed from our thoughts, emotions, memories, and desires. From the outside, it might vary in style—some are magnificent castles, some simple wooden cabins, some futuristic glass structures. But once you step inside, you'll find the internal structure surprisingly similar: it's a six-story building.

The first floor is a spacious, brightly lit hall, connecting to the outside world. Here, we receive guests and handle daily chores.

The second floor is an eternal stage where we play various roles every day, enacting scenes of life's comedies and tragedies.

The third floor is a quiet study and workshop, housing all the knowledge and skills we've acquired.

The fourth floor is a mysterious archive, containing all the building's rules of conduct and hidden regulations that even we ourselves might not know.

The fifth floor is a solemn gallery, with portraits of "who I am" hanging on its walls, defining our existence.

The top floor, the sixth, is a rooftop garden where we can gaze at the stars, feeling connected to something distant.

The problem is, most of us are "specialized" occupants. We're too accustomed to staying on the first and second floors, constantly busy dealing with the winds and rains outside and the performances on stage, so much so that we forget there are rooms upstairs, and even forget that we own the entire building. We don't know what rules are written in the fourth-floor archive, letting them remotely control our lives; we've never carefully examined the portraits on the fifth floor, allowing them to define who we are.

Thus, like Yuan Zhou, we are the owners of this building, yet we live like lost tenants.

---

So, this article isn't meant to give you a new planner or a new "three-step method." It's more like a tour guide, a blueprint of this six-story building.

I invite you to temporarily set aside the urgency to "solve problems" and the judgment of "not being good enough." With the curiosity of a tourist, or the patience of an architect, let's open every door, climb every staircase, and get to know our own house anew.

The purpose of this tour is not to tear down and rebuild this structure—that would be a great pity, as it carries all our life stories, every scratch holding a piece of time. Our goal is to find and reclaim the keys to each floor, which rightfully belong to us.

When we can freely drink tea by the window on the first floor, read in the study on the third floor, and watch the stars from the rooftop on the sixth floor, we will truly become the masters of this building. That "stranger" living in our body will finally be gently seen and reconciled with.

So, are you ready?

Our journey begins in the most familiar place: the first-floor hall.

## Chapter 1: The First Floor | Environment: The World We Respond To

Let's open the door and step into the first floor of this small building.

This is the "reception" and "living room" of the entire structure, where our inner world meets the external world. What do you see? Perhaps a huge floor-to-ceiling window, outside of which is the city you live in, your current office, or the bright screen in front of you. Sunlight or rain pours through the window onto the floor, casting different lights and shadows, and bringing different temperatures.

The furnishings in the hall represent our material conditions, social status, and various resources. Some homes have soft, comfortable luxury sofas, while others only have a simple wooden stool. The bookshelf by the wall might be filled with books, or it might be empty. These are our "factory settings" when our story begins.

There are always guests coming and going in the hall; they are the relationships in our lives. Some guests are warmly welcomed, their arrival filling the entire hall with laughter; others are uninvited, their presence possibly making us feel constrained and uncomfortable. Parents, partners, friends, colleagues, leaders... they move through the hall, making various sounds, leaving various traces.

On the wall, there must be a large clock and an endless calendar. They represent the temporal dimension we inhabit—deadlines that urge us, memorable dates, and the irreversible, ever-forward flow of life.

In addition, the hall is permeated by an unceasing background noise. It comes from the social culture, public opinion, and collective consciousness we are in. It might be news playing on TV, trending topics scrolling on social media, neighborhood gossip, or industry trends... They are like an endlessly looping background music, and being immersed in it for too long, we might even forget its existence.

---

This is the first floor, with which we interact every moment. In psychological terms, it's called the "Environment" level. It includes all external conditions we are in and need to respond to: **time** (when), **place** (where), **people** (with whom), and **objects** (what is around). It forms the objective background of all our life experiences, the answer to the question "Where am I?"

It is so real, vast, and concrete that we often mistakenly believe this first-floor hall is the entirety of our world.

Thus, we naturally equate our internal feelings directly with the external environment.

"The weather is bad today, so I'm in a terrible mood."
"My dysfunctional family is why I turned out this way."
"If this job didn't take up all my time, I would have pursued my dreams long ago."
"This society is too 'involutionary'; no matter how hard I try, it's useless."

This mindset of attributing problems to the environment holds immense appeal for us. Because it offers the simplest, quickest explanation, temporarily freeing us from the guilt and self-doubt of "am I not good enough?" Shifting responsibility to an external environment we cannot control is like finding a "guilty party" in court, which can temporarily protect our fragile self-esteem. It's a psychological "energy-saving mode" that allows us to quickly gain a false but easy sense of control.

But the cost of this temptation is high. When we completely surrender our power to the environment, we also surrender the possibility of change. Our life script, from being actively written, becomes passively received. We transform from potential "creators" into helpless "reactors," sitting passively in the center of the hall, waiting for the weather outside the window, the words of guests, and the background noise to determine our mood and behavior for the day.

I have a friend named Xiaowen, a very talented interior designer. But in the years after graduation, she rarely stayed long at any job, like a migratory bird constantly moving.

At her first company, she often complained to me about her boss's outdated aesthetics, unable to tolerate those "glorious" design requirements; at the second, she felt the problem lay with her colleagues, believing their thinking was rigid and effective teamwork impossible; at the third, a startup, she was initially satisfied, but soon began complaining about the company's chaotic processes and terrible project management. Each time she left, she felt a sense of relief, convinced that "the next one will be better," the next "hall" would surely have more ideal furnishings and guests.

But after experiencing a fourth, almost identical cycle, she fell into deep confusion. That time, we met at a coffee shop, and she stirred her latte, uncharacteristically silent for a long time.

"It's strange," she finally said, "I've changed four completely different 'rooms,' but why does the final feeling always seem the same? Always from initial excitement, to mid-term endurance, to final disappointment and departure."

During that long conversation, she suddenly realized a neglected detail. She said that although the "scenery" of each company was different, in all four "halls," she unconsciously chose the same spot—the corner closest to the door, the darkest, where she could escape at any moment. She always habitually looked for and examined the room's flaws first, rather than its advantages. Her interpersonal pattern was the same; she would always silently label new colleagues as "possibly difficult to work with" in her mind, and then look for evidence.

"I think I understand," she said thoughtfully. "I've been busy changing places, but I've never thought that perhaps the real problem isn't the room itself, but my posture in the room."

Xiaowen's story is like a mirror, clearly reflecting many of us. It tells us that the environment is important; it indeed forms the foundation of our lives. But often, what truly traps us is not the objectively existing environment, but our "relationship" with the environment—how we perceive it, how we interpret it, and what posture we choose to take within it.

---

The environment is objective, but our relationship with it is subjective. This statement might sound abstract, but behind it are two very important operating mechanisms of our brain.

The first is the "interpretation system." Our brain is not a cold camera objectively recording all information. It's more like an experienced "director" who edits and interprets the scene in front of us based on a "script" (our past experiences, memories, and beliefs) already written deep inside. So, the same rain is a romantic poem in the eyes of lovers, but an annoying obstacle in the mind of a traveler rushing to the airport. The rain is still the rain, but our interpretation system assigns it completely different meanings.

The second is "selective attention." Our attention is like a freely moving spotlight. In the information-rich hall of the first floor, wherever our spotlight shines, that scene will be infinitely magnified, becoming our "entire reality." We can choose to continuously shine it on the cobwebs in the corner and the stains on the floor, and thus feel annoyed and dissatisfied; we can also choose to project it onto the orchid on the windowsill, diligently turning towards the sun and quietly blooming, and feel a touch of tranquility and joy from it.

We cannot always choose which hall we enter, just as we cannot choose our native family, and it's difficult to change jobs at will. But we always, always have the right to choose where to shine our spotlight, and which window to stand at to view the scenery. This right to choose is the most precious initiative we can grasp at this seemingly passive level of the first floor.

Now, if you're willing, you can do a small exercise with me.

Please pause for a minute and look around your own "first-floor hall"—the room you're currently in, your work environment, your recent interpersonal relationships.

I know your "spotlight" might habitually be shining on the annoying "noise" and unsatisfactory "furnishings." Now, deliberately, as if moving a real camera lens, slowly shift it away. Look for three beautiful things that have always been there but might have been overlooked by you.

Perhaps it's the warmth of a cup of hot water, just right to warm your hands.
Perhaps it's a melody coming through your headphones, just right to soothe your nerves.
Perhaps it's a kind greeting from a colleague, given unintentionally.
Perhaps it's just the shape of a cloud outside the window, reminding you of a distant memory.

Find them, and let your attention linger on them for ten seconds. Feel the real feelings they bring you.

This simple exercise is the first step from "passive reaction" to "active choice." It's like declaring: although I am in this hall, I am the master who decides what scenery to look at.

---

The first-floor hall is the foundation of our existence, where we shake hands with the world. Acknowledging its influence is seeing reality; but completely surrendering ourselves to it is giving up power. True wisdom is to firmly grasp our right to subjective choice while fully accepting the objective environment.

However, a new problem emerges: why do we habitually shine our spotlight on negative places? Who decides which window we choose to stand at to view the scenery? Simply relying on willpower to "think positively" also often ends in failure.

This seems to imply that the main light switch and curtain pull for the first-floor hall are likely located upstairs.

Now, it's time to visit the second floor. An endless drama is unfolding there, and we are both actors and audience.

## Chapter 2: The Second Floor | Behavior: All That We Do and Think

Climbing a staircase, perhaps carpeted or shining like a mirror, we arrive at the second floor.

The atmosphere here is completely different from the first floor. If the first floor is a relatively static "living room," then the second floor is a bustling, never-ending "theater." The stage lights are always on, and the only actor is ourselves. We perform our entire lives here—every word we speak, every decision we make, and even every thought that flashes through our minds.

The stage set changes continuously with the environment on the first floor. Sometimes it's a cubicle in the office, sometimes it's the dining table at home, sometimes it's amidst the clamor of a friend's gathering. We play different roles under different settings: an employee, a partner, a friend, a child.

Our lines are what we say to others, and more importantly—our never-ending internal monologue to ourselves. Our actions are all our concrete behaviors: a diligent overtime session, an angry quarrel, a kind act of help, an endless procrastination. Our phones, coffee, books, and documents in hand are the most important props in this play.

In the audience, sit those we care about or don't, their gazes, applause, or boos constantly influencing our performance.

---

This is the "Behavior" level of our inner world. It includes all the **concrete actions** we take (running, writing), **words we speak** (arguing, praising), and **specific thought processes** in our minds (planning, worrying). It is the most direct and observable output of our inner world to the outside. Almost all our life stories and the impressions we leave on the world are determined by the drama unfolding on this floor.

For this reason, when we want to change ourselves, our attention is most easily focused here. We believe that as long as we can manage the actor on this stage, making him strictly follow the "script" we've written, our lives will improve.

We've all written inspiring scripts for ourselves, haven't we?

The script is titled "Disciplined Morning," with a plot of waking up at 6 AM sharp, morning run, reading, and healthy breakfast.
The script is titled "Patient Communication," with a plot of staying calm, listening to the other person, and gently expressing oneself when disagreeing with family.
The script is titled "Focused Work," with a plot of single-mindedly handling the most important tasks during work hours, resisting all distracting temptations.

The script is clear, explicit, and full of hope. We confidently tell ourselves: "Tomorrow, I will perform this way."

But strangely, when the stage lights come on the next day, the actor on stage—that is, ourselves—often seems to have picked up the wrong script. He improvises a completely opposite play: one called "The Struggle for Five More Minutes of Sleep," one called "Uncontrollable Angry Roars," one called "Endless Web Browsing and Self-Loathing."

---

This sense of loss of control is so familiar, yet so frustrating. We usually attribute it to "lack of willpower." Thus, we begin a war with ourselves. Our rational self, like a strict director, shouts at the "disobedient" actor from below the stage: "Pull yourself together! Follow the script! You're not allowed to be lazy!"

It's like a long tug-of-war. One end of the rope is our rationality, planning, and beautiful expectations for the future. The other end is the actor's deeply ingrained habits, inexplicable impulses, and momentary desires. We pull with all our might, bringing the rope a little closer to our side, but as soon as we relax, or even just because we're too tired from work today or in a bad mood, the rope is yanked back, sometimes even further than before.

Worse still, after each failed performance, we hold a harsh "internal criticism session." We scold the actor: "I'm so bad," "I'm just a person with no willpower," "I'll never change." This self-reproach, far from improving the next performance, adds immense psychological burden to the actor. When he takes the stage next time, he will be even more timid, less confident in his ability to perform well, and thus more likely to give up.

I have a friend named Lin Kai, who is the most frequent actor I know in the solo play of "quitting smoking." He has tried every method I've heard of: nicotine patches, e-cigarettes, watching various shocking documentaries, and even setting an enlarged photo of his own teeth as his phone wallpaper.

Every attempt to quit smoking was like a grand premiere. He would clear his house of all cigarettes and lighters, announce it to everyone on social media, and accept supervision and encouragement from all. He would chew nicotine gum, painfully enduring the first few days. During that time, he radiated a kind of "sacred irritability."

But the plot always reversed at some unsuspecting moment, triggered by a tiny prop. Perhaps it was a cigarette offered by his boss after overtime; perhaps it was at a friend's gathering, where everyone, tipsy, habitually started puffing away; or perhaps it was just watching an old movie where the protagonist's act of lighting a cigarette suddenly struck him.

He said that at that moment, the internal tug-of-war between "health" and "pleasure" instantly decided its winner. That "stranger" craving nicotine took over his body in just one second. When he finished that "relapse" cigarette, immense pleasure and equally immense shame would drown him. Then, he would silently delete that social media post about quitting smoking, returning to his familiar track, until the next whim, reenacting this drama he knew all too well.

Lin Kai's story is a classic example of a "behavioral level" dilemma. He was always battling the act of "smoking" itself, but never truly stopped to ask: What did this behavior actually bring me?

In psychology, there's a very important concept called "the underlying intention of behavior," or "secondary gain." It refers to the idea that any "bad" behavior we want to quit is so stubborn precisely because it, in some way, perhaps clumsily or harmfully, satisfies a deeper, unseen internal need.

For Lin Kai, the act of "smoking" might have satisfied many needs. When exhausted from overtime, it provided a "legitimate" excuse to pause work and be alone for five minutes; at friend gatherings, it was a social tool to blend in and start conversations; when anxious, it was the fastest, most effective tranquilizer.

These needs—the desire for a breather, the need for social connection, the longing for peace—are perfectly legitimate in themselves. It's just that "smoking" was the most convenient "solution" he found to satisfy these needs throughout his long life.

---

So, perhaps we can draw a conclusion that will relieve many people: the disobedient actor on stage is not lazy, nor is he degenerate; he is merely responding to those unseen desires deep within him, using the only way he knows how. He is not a bad actor; he has simply received a contradictory script.

Forcibly changing behavior is like crudely ordering an actor to improvise without changing the script. Of course, he will mess up, because he doesn't know why he's performing.

This also means that all our efforts at the "behavioral level," if they only stay at the behavior itself, are likely to be superficial and not address the root cause. Because behavior is merely the result of the story, just the tip of the iceberg. It is merely a symptom, not the disease itself.

True change requires us to temporarily shift our gaze from the bustling stage of the second floor, to stop wrestling with the exhausted actor. We need to find the invisible "director," to read the "script" that has never been publicly revealed.

Where are they, then?

Let's go upstairs and see.

## Chapter 3: The Third Floor | Capabilities: How We Do It

Leaving the noisy theater on the second floor, we continue up the stairs to a relatively quiet space—the third floor.

This feels like the "study" and "workshop" of our inner building. The air might be filled with the scent of old books and wood. On the bookshelves by the wall, all the knowledge and theories we've learned are neatly arranged; on the workbench, various tools and skills we rely on are laid out. This is where we answer the question "How to do?"

If "behavior" on the second floor represents our specific actions, then "capability" on the third floor is the systematic talent we form by internalizing and integrating these actions, making them reusable. On the second floor stage, we might perform a single "behavior" very well, for example, giving an exceptionally brilliant speech. But this doesn't mean we possess the "capability to speak publicly." Only when we master the internal principles of public speaking, and can consistently and stably deliver high-quality speeches, does this "behavior" truly settle down, move from the second-floor stage, and enter the third-floor workshop, becoming a handy tool in our toolbox.

---

In psychology, the **"capability" level** refers to the **systematic, repeatable skills, strategies, and mental models** we have mastered and can use. Its fundamental difference from a single behavior lies in its **stability and transferability**. Possessing a capability means we can not only accomplish something in one scenario but also apply it flexibly by analogy in different scenarios.

The acquisition of any complex capability almost always follows a similar path. This path is usually divided into four stages, like four steps to add a new tool to the third-floor workshop.

**The first stage is "unconscious incompetence."** In this stage, we not only can't do something, but we don't even know that we can't, or that the thing exists. Like a primitive person who has never seen a computer, he can't type on a keyboard and is completely unaware of the existence of "typing" as a skill. For a new capability, this is our "chaotic" initial state.

**The second stage is "conscious incompetence."** This is the true starting point of our learning. We begin to encounter this new skill, become aware of its existence, and clearly see the huge gap between ourselves and "being able to do it." This stage is usually painful and clumsy. Think about our first experience learning to drive: our eyes had to watch the rearview mirror, our ears had to listen to the instructor's commands, our left foot had to control the clutch, our right hand had to shift gears, our mind was a mess, and our hands and feet were completely disobedient. We clearly knew we "couldn't," and it required a lot of cognitive resources to barely complete the most basic actions. This is the stage where it's easiest to give up, yet also the stage where we make the fastest progress.

**The third stage is "conscious competence."** After a lot of practice, we finally "can do it." We can recall the steps of "start ignition, shift gears, release handbrake" in our minds and consciously drive the car smoothly on the road. We can complete the task, but the whole process still requires us to maintain a high degree of focus, and it consumes a lot of our energy. Like a programmer who has just learned to code, he needs to constantly consult resources and carefully type each line of code to ensure the program runs without errors. We can do it, but we're not yet proficient.

**The fourth stage is "unconscious competence."** This is the mark of a truly "internalized" capability. When our mastery of a skill reaches perfection, it no longer requires us to consciously think and control it. It seems to be etched into our muscle memory and neural pathways, becoming an almost instinctive, automatic response. Like an experienced old driver, he can drive while listening to music, chatting, or even thinking about problems, with all driving operations automatically handled by the subconscious. This capability has transformed from a "tool" that needs constant polishing into an "organ" that extends from our body.

---

I have a friend who, a few years ago, was considered the "DIY idiot" in our circle. If a light bulb broke at home, he'd rather stumble around in the dark for two days than wait for the building superintendent to come. Furniture from IKEA would leave him utterly confused by the instructions. In his own words: "I'm just not cut out for this."

Later, he bought an old house that needed extensive renovation. Perhaps it was limited budget, or perhaps something suddenly ignited his fighting spirit, but he decided to do it himself. I still remember his initial awkwardness. It was a weekend, and I went to see him. He was assembling a bookshelf. Various screws and wooden boards were scattered on the floor, and he was sweating profusely, staring at the instructions with a mixture of anger and bewilderment. That day, it took us an entire afternoon to barely get that wobbly bookshelf standing.

This was his "conscious incompetence" stage. He knew he couldn't do it, and every step was filled with frustration.

But he didn't give up. He started watching many tutorial videos online, learning from the basics of how to use a power drill. He bought a stack of tool books, researched wall painting techniques, and learned how to connect pipes. When I visited his house again, I saw various failed wood pieces and materials piled on the balcony. His hands also began to show various scars and calluses.

Slowly, changes occurred. He sent me photos; he had successfully laid the kitchen floor tiles. After some more time, he built a beautiful brick bar counter himself. On the phone, he could clearly articulate the characteristics of different paints and discuss the pros and cons of various wood types. He had entered the "conscious competence" stage. He could do it, and he was getting better at it, but every step still required planning and thought.

Another year passed, and when I visited his house again, I barely recognized it. The entire house was meticulously organized by him, filled with various clever designs. That day, he was making a small wooden horse for his daughter. He wore safety goggles, skillfully operated the cutting machine, planed, sanded, and painted, all actions flowing seamlessly, like an experienced craftsman. I could no longer see the young man who was once helpless with instructions. This skill, which had once terrified him, had now become a part of him, an "unconscious competence."

This story vividly illustrates how capabilities are built. It tells us that every tool in our third-floor study is almost always acquired in this way, from nothing to everything, from clumsiness to mastery, through countless tedious practices and efforts.

---

However, a new, deeper question also arises.

Many of us are not actually lacking in capability. In today's information-rich era, our "study" on the third floor might be filled with various "advanced tools" and "perfect blueprints" for problem-solving. We know how to eat healthily, how to communicate effectively, how to manage emotions. We possess the knowledge of these "capabilities," and some of us have even successfully applied them at certain times.

But why, more often than not, do we prefer to let these advanced tools gather dust on the third-floor bookshelf, and instead go to the second-floor stage to perform in the most primitive, clumsy, and even self-loathing ways?

Why do we "know" so much, yet still live our lives poorly?

What exactly is that huge chasm between "knowing" and "doing"?

This seems to imply that even if we have a room full of tools, whether or not to use them, and which tools are permitted, this "permission" is controlled by a higher authority upstairs.

Now, it's time to go to the fourth floor. It might be a bit dim there, holding all the true secrets of this building.

## Chapter 4: The Fourth Floor | Beliefs and Values: Why We Choose As We Do

The staircase leading to the fourth floor might be narrow and dim, perhaps even dusty. We rarely come here.

Opening the door, you might feel the air is somewhat heavy. This place is unlike any floor below. It's not a living room, not a theater, nor a study. It's more like a vast and intricate "power distribution room" and "archive." The walls are covered with dense wiring, switches, and control panels, with countless indicator lights flickering in the gloom. In the center of the room stands rows of tall filing cabinets, containing all the "rules and regulations" and "operating principles" of this building since its construction.

This is the fourth level of our inner world. It determines the flow of energy throughout the entire building and defines the boundaries of all actions. What is stored here are our beliefs and values.

---

In psychology, **"beliefs"** are our subjective judgments about "what the world is." They are not facts, but "facts" we choose to believe. For example, "the world is dangerous," "effort will pay off," "I am not good with words"... these are all beliefs. They act like "filters" in our brain, sifting, coloring, and processing all incoming information between us and the real world.

And **"values"** are our internal standards for "what is more important." They concern priorities. For instance, between "security" and "freedom," which do you value more? Between "achievement" and "family," which comes first? Our values are like an internal "navigation system" that guides us in making choices when we face life's crossroads.

Beliefs and values together form the underlying operating system for our decisions and behaviors. They are like the most basic "if-then" statements in a computer program, running automatically in the background without us even realizing it, filtering the information we see, triggering our emotional responses, and ultimately leading to specific behaviors.

For example, a person who deeply believes "the world is dangerous" will automatically focus their attention "spotlight" on potential threats in the environment; in interpersonal interactions, they will be more inclined to suspicion and caution; when facing opportunities, they might shrink back due to fear of risk. The entire building's electrical system is laid out around this core belief of "danger," and the operation of all floors takes "ensuring safety" as its highest directive.

These crucial "core codes" are mostly quietly written in during our early lives, especially childhood. They might come from repeated parental admonitions ("Don't trust strangers easily"), from a deeply personal experience (a painful betrayal), or from being subtly influenced by the social culture we live in. At the time, the formation of these beliefs was often to protect us and help us adapt to our environment. But as we grow, the outside world has long since turned upside down, yet these deeply buried, outdated "rules" on the fourth floor continue to faithfully operate, limiting our possibilities today.

What we often call "mind imprints" are stamped right here.

I once heard a story about an artist.

This artist, Julian, was exceptionally talented, his paintings filled with astonishing imagination and vitality. All his teachers and peers who saw his work believed he had a promising future. But he had a strange pattern: he could easily win awards in small art exhibitions, but whenever he faced greater opportunities—such as a national art exhibition or an invitation to sign with a famous gallery—he would always "mess it up" in various inexplicable ways at the last minute.

Sometimes he "accidentally" missed the submission deadline for his work; sometimes he inexplicably got heavily drunk the night before the most important meeting; and once, he even "lost" his portfolio that he had prepared for half a year.

Those around him regretted it, thinking he was just "unlucky." He himself fell into deep confusion and self-blame; his "behaviors" on the second floor were filled with self-sabotage, and his "capabilities" on the third floor were completely unable to be utilized. He tried various methods, set stricter schedules, sought supervision from friends, but all to little avail.

The turning point came during a very accidental hypnotherapy experience. In a deeply relaxed state, the therapist guided him back to those moments of "messing up," to feel the emotions at that time. In that blurry space of consciousness, he touched a deep, long-ignored feeling—fear.

Delving deeper, a long-sealed childhood scene emerged before him. He was about seven or eight years old, and one of his paintings had won an award at school. He excitedly ran home with the certificate, wanting praise from his father. His father, a stern and unsuccessful old-school painter, took his painting, examined it for a long time, and finally said coldly, "You have a little cleverness, but don't get arrogant. People in our family don't have that 'fate.' The higher you climb, the harder you'll fall."

It was this unintentional remark that, like a seed, fell into his young heart. To "safely" survive in such a family environment, he unconsciously accepted and internalized this conclusion, and in the fourth-floor archive, with childish handwriting, he wrote a core rule for himself: "Success is dangerous; it brings punishment and downfall. I don't deserve true success."

This deeply buried belief, in his later life, became an incredibly loyal "guardian." Whenever Julian approached true, significant success, this "guardian" would be activated. It would pull the "main switch" of the entire building, creating all sorts of chaos and accidents, to protect him from the imagined "the higher you climb, the harder you fall," devastating harm.

When Julian, in the therapy room, tearfully "saw" all this, he finally understood that the self who repeatedly "messed everything up" was not trying to destroy him, but was protecting him in a clumsy way. His seemingly irrational self-sabotaging behaviors on the second floor all originated from this long-forgotten, fear-filled "rule" on the fourth floor.

---

This story powerfully confirms the immense power of beliefs. It tells us that if we don't visit the fourth-floor archive, if we don't examine the "core codes" we don't even know we possess, then all our efforts on the floors below, aimed at "self-improvement," might fail due to "power shortage" or "system conflicts."

So, how do we begin this exploration of the fourth floor?

This is undoubtedly a journey that requires patience and courage. Because we are about to touch the core structures that we have layered and wrapped to define our world. Directly "modifying" them often provokes strong internal resistance. Therefore, our first step is not to modify, or even to judge, but merely to—"see."

You can try, in a quiet moment, to ask yourself these questions:

*   What do I deeply believe about "money"? (Is it "scarce, dirty," or "abundant, neutral"?)
*   What do I deeply believe about "interpersonal relationships"? (Is it "troublesome, unreliable," or "nurturing, trustworthy"?)
*   What do I deeply believe about "myself"? (Is it "not good enough, flawed," or "worthy of love, valuable"?)

When you think about these topics, pay attention to the first, unthinking thought that flashes in your mind. That thought is often the most prominent label on the fourth-floor archive cabinet.

You don't need to immediately refute it. You just need to be like a visiting librarian, holding a flashlight, quietly illuminating it, seeing its existence, and saying to yourself: "Oh, so my archive has such a rule."

This "seeing" itself is the beginning of change. It means that you are starting to shift from being a "rule-follower" to a "rule-observer." When light enters this dim room, we gain the first possibility of choosing anew.

## Chapter 5: The Fifth Floor | Self-Identity: Who We Are

Emerging from the archive room on the fourth floor, which holds secret rules, we continue upward. The staircase to the fifth floor seems even more solemn. You might find that the materials here have changed, perhaps heavy solid wood or smooth marble. The air also becomes exceptionally quiet, as if entering a sacred space.

This is the fifth floor, the "gallery" of our inner building.

On the walls of the room, there are no windows, nor are they needed. Soft light streams down from the skylight, evenly illuminating the portraits hanging on the walls. These paintings all depict the same person—ourselves. Yet each one has a completely different posture, expression, and background.

One depicts a child, perhaps curled in a corner, titled "A Superfluous Person." Next to it, a diligent student, buried in books, titled "A Hardworking Good Student." Further on, an adult in professional attire, with a hint of subtle fatigue on their face, titled "A Responsible Employee." And there are "An Introverted Person," "A Strong Survivor," "A Failed Entrepreneur," "An Ordinary Person"...

These portraits collectively form the theme of this gallery. They answer the most fundamental question deep within us: "Who am I?"

---

This is the fifth level of our inner world, the **"Self-Identity"** level. It is more core and refined than the "Beliefs and Values" on the fourth floor. If beliefs and values are the "code" in our operating system, then self-identity is the "name and version number" of that operating system. It's not what we have, not what we can do, not even what we believe, but what we ultimately declare, "I am."

It is the ultimate compilation of all our beliefs and values, unconsciously integrated into a core story about "me" throughout our long lives.

This core story possesses the most powerful force in the entire building. In social psychology, there's a classic concept called "cognitive dissonance," which refers to the intense discomfort we feel when our behavior conflicts with our beliefs. And what makes us most uncomfortable is when our behavior conflicts with that core "self-portrait" in our fifth-floor gallery.

To maintain inner harmony and consistency, we unconsciously act in ways that align with our self-identity. This is like a massive gravitational field; it effortlessly pulls the operations of all floors below us—our beliefs, capabilities, behaviors, and even our interpretation of the environment—towards it, keeping them consistent with it.

This is why identity-level changes bring more lasting and powerful effects than behavioral-level changes.

Someone who defines themselves as "a person trying to quit smoking" has a whole story filled with struggle, resistance, and potential failure. Each time they smoke, it confirms the belief that "quitting smoking is hard," and each struggle depletes their limited willpower.

But if they can successfully change the core self-portrait in their fifth-floor gallery from "A Struggling Smoker" to "A Person Who Chooses a Healthy Lifestyle," then the energy flow of the entire building will change.

As a "healthy living person," they will naturally focus on healthy eating (beliefs), learn about fitness (capabilities), choose to run instead of lounging on the sofa (behaviors), and they will even prefer to spend time with friends who also love exercise (environment). Quitting smoking is no longer a painful "war," but a natural "outcome" of a healthy lifestyle that requires little struggle. They no longer need to fight anything with "willpower," because the new identity has paved a new, easier path for them.

---

I have a friend who, through this method, completed an important transformation of himself.

His name is Wenjie, and he has been a very introverted person since childhood. In the era we grew up in, "introversion" was often considered a flaw. Teachers would say he was "not lively enough," and relatives would say he was "not generous." Over time, he accepted this label himself. In his fifth-floor gallery, his most core self-portrait was a somewhat dim one titled "An Inarticulate Introvert."

This identity, like an invisible curse, hung over him for many years. In social situations, he would feel immense pressure because his "core code" told him: "I can't do it, I'm not cut out for this." So he would choose silence and avoidance (behavior), which further confirmed his belief that he was "inarticulate." He missed many opportunities, whether project collaborations at work or emotional connections in his personal life, all limited by this "identity."

He also tried to change. He went to the third-floor study, read many books on public speaking and communication skills, and even memorized some "standard phrases" for social occasions. But these "capabilities" were like external patches, incompatible with his inner operating system. In practical application, he always seemed stiff, like a clumsy actor reciting lines. That sense of internal conflict made him even more exhausted.

The turning point came after he encountered psychology. He began to realize that "introversion" itself is just a neutral temperament trait, like being left-handed or right-handed, with no inherent good or bad. What truly trapped him was not the fact of "introversion," but the negative "identity label" he had attached to it.

So, he began a long and quiet "gallery reorganization" project. He didn't force himself to become "extroverted," but instead tried to paint a new self-portrait. He asked himself: As an introverted person, what are my strengths?

He found that although he wasn't good at talking animatedly in a crowd, he was very good at one-on-one deep listening. He could keenly pick up subtle changes in others' emotions.
He found that although he didn't like small talk, he could engage in deep, insightful thinking and expression on topics he was genuinely interested in.
He found that although he didn't have many friends, every friendship he had was very genuine and lasting.

Gradually, a new portrait became clear in his mind. The title of this painting was—"A Deep Listener and Thoughtful Observer."

When he started acting from this new identity, something wonderful happened. In meetings, he no longer forced himself to rush to speak, but chose to quietly listen to everyone's opinions, and then, at the end, raise that well-thought-out, core question. At gatherings, he no longer felt anxious about not fitting into the noise, but would find a friend who also liked quiet, and engage in a more meaningful, deep conversation.

He was still Wenjie; his inner temperament hadn't changed. But the core portrait in his fifth-floor gallery had been completely refreshed. This new identity found a new, self-consistent outlet for all his beliefs, capabilities, and behaviors on the floors below. He no longer fought with himself, but truly reconciled with himself.

---

Wenjie's story tells us that we are not merely passive recipients of those faded old portraits in the fifth-floor gallery. We are, in fact, the "curators" of our own gallery.

We have the power to re-examine each painting. We can ask ourselves: Who painted this? Was it myself, or did someone else paint it for me when I was young? Does it depict who I am now, or who I used to be? Does it make me feel more powerful, or more powerless?

We have the right to decide which paintings to hang in the most central position in the gallery and which to move to a corner storage room. We can even, like Wenjie, pick up a paintbrush and paint a brand new self-portrait that better aligns with our life's aspirations.

This is perhaps the most difficult, yet most exciting, task in the entire building. Because changing any stroke here means redefining the entire structure.

When you begin to ponder the question "Who am I?" and try to offer new answers, you are already standing in the center of the fifth-floor gallery, paintbrush in hand, ready to paint the most important masterpiece of your life.

## Chapter 6: The Sixth Floor | Spirituality: Our Connection to Something Greater

Passing through the quiet gallery on the fifth floor, we come to a perhaps narrow spiral staircase leading to a higher place. Pushing open the heavy door at the end, a refreshing breeze greets us, and the view suddenly opens up.

We have arrived at the sixth floor. This is not an enclosed room, but an open "rooftop garden."

Standing here, we can overlook everything below: the comings and goings of guests on the first floor, the drama on the second-floor stage, the lights of the third-floor study, the depths of the fourth-floor archive, the solemnity of the fifth-floor gallery. Everything is visible. But more importantly, when we look up, we see a vast, boundless sky. Whether it's the rolling clouds of day or the myriad stars of night, they are directly connected to us.

This is the highest level of our inner building. It allows us to transcend the building itself and contemplate an ultimate question: "Why does this building exist here?"

---

This is the sixth level of our inner world, often referred to as **"Spirituality."**

The word "spirituality" is often associated with religion or mysticism, making it seem distant and impractical. But in the context of our small building, we can demystify it and give it a more universal, solid definition.

**"Spirituality" is a sense of personal connection to a larger system that transcends the self.**

This "larger system" can take many forms. For a scientist, it might be the desire to explore the truth of the universe; for an artist, it might be the pursuit of creating beauty; for an educator, it might be the mission to inspire future generations; for a community member, it might be a sense of belonging to the collective well-being. It can even be our deep connection with nature, culture, history, or some ideal we cherish.

It answers the most fundamental questions deep within us: "Why am I here?" "What does my life serve?" "Beyond satisfying my personal needs, what greater, long-term meaning does all this have?"

This sense of connection provides our life with a "coordinate system" that transcends personal joys and sorrows. It acts like an invisible anchor, connecting our small building, floating on the sea of time, to a broader, more enduring harbor. When a person is anchored at the spiritual level, when they find their own "starry sky," all their struggles and efforts on the floors below are given new perspective and meaning.

The environment on the first floor may still be noisy; behaviors on the second floor may still be clumsy and repetitive; capabilities on the third floor may still need refining; beliefs on the fourth floor may still conflict; identity on the fifth floor may still be explored. However, when they ascend to the sixth floor and see the starry sky guiding them, all these struggles are no longer annoying "problems," but meaningful "processes" for reaching that direction.

Striving is no longer just about proving oneself to others (identity), nor merely about following certain rules (beliefs), but about enabling one's own small building to better receive signals from that starry sky, to better serve that larger connection.

I once heard a senior tell the story of his father.

His father was a respected middle school physics teacher who taught his entire life in a small county town. In that era of material scarcity, he supported his family by living frugally on his meager salary. The senior said that in his childhood memories, his father was always busy and serious. He would prepare lessons late into the night, his "behaviors" on the second floor almost entirely revolving around work; his "capabilities" on the third floor—his knowledge of physics—were his most valuable asset; his "beliefs" on the fourth floor—that knowledge changes destiny; his "identity" on the fifth floor—a "strict teacher" and "responsible father."

After retirement, his father's life suddenly became empty. Away from the podium and students, he seemed to have lost his most important bearings. He became taciturn, spending his days watching TV, watering plants, occasionally losing his temper over small household matters. All the systems on the floors below him fell into disarray because they had lost their core "service object."

His family was very worried about him and tried everything to make him "happy." They took him on trips, bought him various nutritional supplements, but with little effect. He remained like a plant deprived of sunlight, slowly withering.

The change came about by a very accidental opportunity. There were a few children in the community whose parents were both working, and they often wandered outside after school because no one looked after them. His father, feeling compassion, invited these children to his home and tutored them for free.

At first, there were only one or two, but then word spread, and more and more children came. His father simply converted the living room into a small "community reading room." He brought out his treasured physics and chemistry teaching models again, told the children stories about the universe, and led them in interesting science experiments.

The senior said that during that time, he watched his father, like a withered tree, come back to life. A smile returned to his face, and his eyes regained their sparkle. He no longer dwelled on life's trivialities, nor did he complain about his various physical discomforts. His entire life seemed to have been rekindled.

One day, the senior asked him: "Dad, you're this old, what are you doing it for?"

His father, wearing his reading glasses, was repairing an old globe. Without looking up, he said: "Nothing much, I just feel that these children need someone to light a lamp of curiosity about the world in their hearts. In my life, I don't know how to do anything else, but I can do this."

At that moment, the senior suddenly understood. His father, after retirement, had for a time lost connection with the "larger system" he had served his whole life—"educating people." And this small community reading room allowed him to reconnect, in a new way, with the mission he cherished most, one that transcended himself.

He found his own "starry sky." This starry sky illuminated his later life, giving new meaning to every floor of his inner building.

---

Ascending to the sixth-floor rooftop garden doesn't necessarily require doing anything earth-shattering. It's more about an internal shift in perspective.

It's when we begin to shift from "what I want to get" to "what I can contribute."
It's when we shift from focusing on "personal growth" to focusing on "my relationship with the world."
It's when we are willing to let our own small building be a node in a larger network, to shine, to connect, to serve.

This process may not immediately solve all the problems downstairs. But it will give us a broader container to hold those problems. It will give us a longer-term direction to navigate through the present fog.

Because when we find our own starry sky, we possess the most powerful internal driving force.

## Chapter 7: Integration | Becoming the Wise Owner of the Building

Thus, we have completed the initial tour of this six-story building. From the objective environment on the first floor to the spiritual connection on the sixth floor, we have explored each level that constitutes our inner world.

But this building is not six isolated, static rooms. It is a dynamic, interconnected organic whole. A wise inhabitant not only understands the function of each room but also knows how to move freely between them and synergistically use their power.

This process we call "integration."

---

In psychology, **"integration"** means consciously aware and synergistically utilizing the capabilities of all six levels. And the key to achieving integration lies in cultivating **"hierarchical fluidity"**—that is, when facing specific problems, not being fixated on a single level of thinking, but being able to flexibly switch perspectives between levels, like a skilled photographer changing lens focal lengths, thereby gaining a more comprehensive and three-dimensional understanding of the problem and finding the most powerful solution.

Our previous tour was mostly by "stairs," climbing one floor at a time. This is a necessary process for building a solid foundation. But within this building, there's actually a faster mode of transportation hidden—the "elevator."

The "elevator" represents those moments of "epiphany" in our lives. It might be triggered by a friend's remark during a deep conversation; it might be moved by the scenery during a trip; or it might be an intrinsic potential ignited during a crisis. In those moments, we seem to instantly traverse all floors, seeing the full scope of the problem from a new, higher-dimensional perspective, and the old troubles dissipate.

We cannot deliberately "press the elevator button," but we can create more favorable conditions for "epiphanies" to occur by becoming more familiar with this building. And cultivating "hierarchical fluidity" is the most important "elevator riding guide" we can deliberately practice daily.

Let's use a pervasive problem that many people have experienced—"fear of public speaking"—to systematically demonstrate how a thinker with "hierarchical fluidity" views and solves this problem through these six "windows."

**When he stands at the window of the first floor (Environment), he asks:**
*   "What external environmental factors can I adjust to reduce the difficulty of this speech?"
*   He might choose a more familiar, secure venue; he will ensure the presentation equipment (PPT, microphone) is optimally set up; he might even engage in friendly conversations with a few audience members before the speech to create a more harmonious interpersonal atmosphere for himself. He won't complain about the environment; he will actively optimize it.

**When he comes to the window of the second floor (Behavior), he asks:**
*   "What specific behaviors do I need to execute for this speech?"
*   He will create a detailed practice plan, simulating the speech repeatedly in front of a mirror; he will record his voice, listen back, and correct his speaking speed and tone; he will practice deep breathing as a specific action to alleviate nervousness before going on stage. He won't just dwell on a vague wish of "I want to perform well"; he will break it down into executable, specific behaviors.

**When he ascends to the window of the third floor (Capability), he asks:**
*   "What capabilities do I need to learn or improve to support this speech?"
*   He might discover he lacks clear logical structuring ability and then studies the pyramid principle; he might feel he lacks vivid expressive ability and then watches videos of excellent speakers to learn their techniques; he might also learn methods for managing the audience and interacting with them. He won't say "I'm naturally not good at public speaking"; he will transform this vague problem into "What specific capabilities do I need to learn?"

**When he steps into the window of the fourth floor (Beliefs), he asks:**
*   "What beliefs do I harbor deep down about 'public speaking'?"
*   He might become aware of some limiting beliefs, such as: "No one will be interested in what I say," "I'll be mocked if I make a mistake," "I must be perfect." He will consciously challenge these beliefs, look for counterexamples, and try to implant new, more empowering beliefs, such as: "My sharing is valuable," "The audience is friendly and forgiving," "Completion is more important than perfection."

**When he arrives at the window of the fifth floor (Identity), he asks:**
*   "What 'identity' will I adopt for this speech?"
*   He has many identities to choose from: "a fearful person trying not to mess up," "an employee forced to complete a task." But he can also choose a more proactive, powerful identity for himself, such as: "an enthusiastic knowledge sharer," "a guide trying to inspire others." When he acts from the identity of a "sharer," his focus will shift from "what will others think of me" to "what value can I bring to the audience," and his inner fear will consequently decrease.

**Finally, when he ascends to the window of the sixth floor (Spirituality), he asks:**
*   "What is the connection between this speech and my long-term life meaning?"
*   He might consider that the content of this presentation is in his cherished professional field and can help newcomers in the industry; or that the success of this speech can win him a more important project, and that project is related to his life ideal of serving society. When he connects this speech to a greater meaning, personal gains and losses and nervous emotions will be relegated to a secondary position.

---

You see, for the same "fear of public speaking," when we have the ability to freely switch perspectives across the six levels, it is no longer a rigid, unshakeable "problem," but becomes a "project" that can be approached from multiple levels and has multiple solutions.

This is the power of "integration." It transforms us from a "victim" trapped by a problem into a "master" who possesses all the building's resources and can calmly face challenges.

To help you better practice this way of thinking in your life, here is a simple "self-diagnosis" framework. The next time you encounter a difficulty and feel "stuck," try taking out a pen and paper and, following these six levels, ask yourself:

*   **Environment Level:** Can I change or optimize my current environment?
*   **Behavior Level:** Can I take some new, specific, small actions?
*   **Capability Level:** Do I need to learn a new skill or knowledge?
*   **Belief Level:** What are my deepest beliefs about this matter? Is it limiting me or helping me?
*   **Identity Level:** In this situation, what "role" do I see myself as? Can I adopt a more powerful role?
*   **Spirituality Level:** What does achieving this mean for my long-term life?

You don't need to find perfect answers at every level. Many times, you might find that the most critical "bottleneck" is only on one or two floors. And once you gently nudge at that most powerful leverage point, the energy of the entire building might begin to flow again.

## Chapter 8: The Foundation | Sense of Security: The Prerequisite for All Exploration

Before we conclude this tour of our inner building, there is one last, and most important, place to examine.

It is not on any of the six floors. It is in a place we cannot see, beneath the entire structure. It is the silent "foundation" that supports everything.

If the foundation is unstable, then all the "renovations" and "modifications" we make upstairs may be futile, or even dangerous. This crucial foundation is our "psychological sense of security."

---

**"Psychological sense of security"** is a fundamental, internal sense of stability. It stems from a core belief: a belief that one is safe, worthy of acceptance, and capable of coping with the basic challenges of the world. It acts like the "immune system" of our mental world, helping us resist external pressures and uncertainties, and maintain internal order and balance.

This foundation is primarily laid early in our lives, especially through interactions with primary caregivers. A child who grows up in a loving, stable, and predictable environment will have their inner building constructed upon a solid, deep foundation. They will believe that the world is generally friendly, that they are lovable, and that difficulties can be overcome.

Conversely, a child who grows up in an environment filled with neglect, chaos, or harm may have a shallow or even cracked foundation. They will unconsciously believe that the world is dangerous, that they are flawed, and that disaster could strike at any moment.

When the foundation is unstable, the entire building remains in a constant state of "alert." A significant amount of psychological energy is consumed by the most basic need for "survival." In this state, our brains prioritize information related to threats, and our bodies remain in a prolonged state of stress. This is like a country that, when facing the threat of external invasion, diverts all its resources to the front lines, while economic development and cultural progress (corresponding to our inner higher-level exploration) are temporarily put on hold.

Therefore, when we talk about exploring beliefs on the fourth floor, reshaping identity on the fifth, and connecting with spirituality on the sixth, we must first ask ourselves a fundamental question: Do I feel safe enough right now?

If you are experiencing immense existential anxiety (e.g., unemployment, debt), if you are deeply entangled in a harmful relationship, or if you are overwhelmed by feelings of depression or anxiety, then forcing yourself to engage in high-level self-reflection and transformation may be unrealistic, even cruel. This is like asking a building with a cracking foundation to withstand a lavish renovation. The result is likely further damage to the structure.

---

So, before embarking on any profound journey of inner growth, the most important and compassionate step is to return to the "construction site" of our inner building, to inspect and repair our foundation. Building and repairing a sense of psychological security is the prerequisite for all exploration.

This is not an abstract concept; it can be re-established through very concrete, actionable behaviors.

**First, establish external "predictability."** For someone with an unstable foundation, a stable, predictable external environment is the best "scaffolding." This means, as much as possible, establishing a regular daily rhythm for yourself: fixed waking and sleeping times, regular meals, consistent exercise. These seemingly trivial small things are like telling our frightened inner child: "Don't be afraid, everything is on track, life is controllable."

**Second, practice "self-compassion."** A person lacking a sense of security often harbors a harsh "inner critic" who constantly judges and attacks them. Self-compassion is consciously replacing that critic with a warm, loving voice. It's telling yourself, "It's okay, that was just a mistake, it doesn't mean you're bad," when you mess up; it's allowing yourself to rest when you feel tired, instead of pushing yourself to "not stop."

**Finally, seek "social support."** Humans are social animals, and our sense of security largely comes from safe connections with others. This means moving closer to those who bring you warmth, support, and nourishment, and moving away from those who drain or judge you. Sometimes, confiding in a trusted friend or seeking the help of a professional therapist is the most important "foundation strengthening" project we can undertake for our own building.

This process can be long and requires immense patience. But please believe that it is the most worthwhile investment.

Because only when the foundation is solid do we have the true courage and strength to push open those long-sealed doors upstairs, to face our deepest fears, to repaint our most core self-portraits, and ultimately, to ascend to the rooftop and behold our own vast starry sky.

## Conclusion: Lighting Every Lamp in Our Home

Our journey, at this point, is nearing its end.

We started from the bustling hall on the first floor, connecting to the outside world, and ascended upwards. We explored the never-ending stage on the second floor, witnessing the behavioral dramas we enact day after day; we stepped into the third-floor study, filled with tools, examining the various capabilities we possess; we bravely pushed open the door to the fourth-floor archive, where our life's "core code" is stored, catching a glimpse of the hidden beliefs that drive us; we climbed higher, entering the solemn gallery on the fifth floor, contemplating the self-portraits of "who I am" hanging on the walls; and we finally reached the rooftop garden on the sixth floor, where we could look up and search for the starry sky that guides our direction.

At the end of our tour, we also examined the silent yet crucial foundation that supports the entire building—our inner sense of security.

Now, it's time to return to the center of this building and re-examine it.

---

Before embarking on this journey, many of us, perhaps like my friend Yuan Zhou, felt "lost" in the home we built with our own hands. We might have approached it with a "mechanic's" mindset, trying to find the "broken" part, fixing it, replacing it, and then expecting the entire building to operate perfectly forever.

But after this tour, we might arrive at a new, gentler conclusion.

This inner building of ours is not a machine; no part of it is "broken." The environment on the first floor is the soil of our existence; the behaviors on the second floor are our clumsy expressions; the capabilities on the third floor are proof of our efforts; the beliefs on the fourth floor were once our childhood armor; the identity on the fifth floor is our promise to ourselves; the starry sky on the sixth floor is our longing for the distant.

Every level has its reason for existence and its unique value. True growth is not about us despising the lower levels and only living on the higher ones, nor is it about tearing down this building, which is full of life's traces, and replacing it with a seemingly more glamorous "show home."

True growth is about transforming from a lost "tenant" or an anxious "mechanic" into a free "owner" who understands and fully accepts their unique building.

A wise owner understands every structure in their home. They know which window on the first floor offers the most beautiful sunset; they know why similar dramas always play out on the second-floor stage; they are familiar with every tool in the third-floor toolbox; they have the courage to enter the fourth-floor archive to dust off old regulations; they will often pause in the fifth-floor gallery, considering whether to paint a new self-portrait; and they will never forget, when feeling lost, to ascend to the sixth-floor rooftop to gaze at the perpetually twinkling starry sky.

He no longer wars with his own house. He knows that all the "imperfections" in this building—the cracks, the scratches, the slightly worn furniture—carry his unique life story and deserve to be seen and respected.

The ultimate wisdom, perhaps, is to possess the ability to always find a quiet corner within, holding the "master switch" of the entire building. Then, according to the present need, gently and consciously, light up each and every lamp on every floor of the home.

May you, too, become the calm person who lights the lamps in your own home.
